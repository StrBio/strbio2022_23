# Structure comparison and alignment {#sec-alignment}

As in the case of sequences, comparison and alignment of protein structures is a
fundamental and widely used task in computational structure biology. The
identification and statistical measure of the similarities between two or more
structures allow their classification and infer functional and evolutionary
relationships. Moreover, this process is essential during protein modeling,
allowing to identify, assess, and select intermediate models.

It is also important to clear up any possible confusion between alignment and
superposition, as they are often interchanged in the literature. An structural
alignment tries to identify similarities and differences between two structures,
while structure superposition requires the previous knowledge of such
equivalences. Thus, superposition tires to minimize the distance between already
known equivalent structures by finding a transformation that produces either the
lowest root-mean-square deviation
([**RMSD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions))
or the maximal equivalences within an RMSD cutoff. The RMSD can be calculated
for any pair of molecules. Regarding proteins, we usually refer to the *RMSD of
the alpha-carbons*. A better alignment will allow a better superposition. Thus,
although alignment and superposition are two different processes, the RMSD can
be used as an indication of both (the lowest RMSD, the best
alignment/superposition).

# Major protein databases

Classification of protein sequences allow to understand the diversity of
different proteins by their sequence, i.e., the protein sequence space. However,
classification of protein structures aim to group proteins based on their
structural relationships. Some of these classification schemes explore the
concept of structural neighbourhood (structural continuum), whereas other
utilize the notion of protein evolution as a driving force of diversification
and thus provide a discrete rather than continuum protein structure space
[@andreeva2012].

This section does not aim to comprehensively review all protein databases in
detail. Indeed, you probably already know most of the databases we are
discussing. We will clarify the main differences and applications of Pfam,
Uniprot, Prosite, PDB, SCOP & CATH. As usual, I encourage you to check out
online in the references mentioned below for more detailed information.

![Major protein databases. Although most of these databases are around 30 years
old (or more), since they were created (or renovated) during the last years of
the 20th century or the early
21st.](pics/ddbb.png "Protein databases"){#fig-ddbb .figure width="383"}

In bioinformatics, databases are often categorized as primary or secondary.
**Primary databases** are populated with experimentally derived data such as
nucleotide sequence, protein sequence or macromolecular structure. Importantly,
once given a database accession number, the data in primary databases are never
changed: they form part of the scientific record. By contrast, **secondary
databases** comprise data derived from the results of analysing primary data.
Secondary databases often draw upon information from numerous sources, including
other databases and the scientific literature. They are highly curated, often
using a complex combination of computational algorithms and/or manual analysis
and interpretation to derive new knowledge from the public record of science.

The main protein primary databases are NCBI Protein for protein sequenes and
RCSB-PDB for protein structures. Uniprot (see below) also contains a primary
sequence database, named TrEMBL. It also incorporated in 2002 PIR-PSD, joining
the databases of the Protein information Resource, EMBL and SIB in a single
(meta)database (see
<https://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/dbinfo/pir_psd.shtml>).

## Sequence databases

### Uniprot

The [Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/) databases are maintained by the Uniprot
consortium, created in 2002 by
[EMBL-EBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute),
[SIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Institute_of_Bioinformatics), and
[PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Information_Resource). Uniprot can
be considered nowadays as a metadatabase as its entries contain information from
diverse sources. It was created with two goals, constitute a non-redundant
comprehensive protein sequence database and enrich that database with annotation
of those proteins. Annotations include, but it is not limited to: protein and
gene families, function and structure-function available data, interactions with
other proteins or cofactor, localization, patterns of expression, variants...
Thus, it aims to join the goals of both primary and secondary DDBBs.

The central hub of Uniprot databases is [Uniprot
Knowledgebase](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb). It is a collection of
functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent, and rich
annotation. The UniProtKB consists of two internal databases: a section
containing manually-annotated records with information extracted from
literature, community suggestions, and curator-evaluated computational analysis,
and a section with computationally analyzed records. For the sake of continuity
and name recognition, the two sections are referred to as "UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot"
(reviewed, manually annotated) and "UniProtKB/TrEMBL" (unreviewed, automatically
annotated), respectively.

Besides cross-references to structural information, in the last years, UniprotKB
has also incorporated structural data from
[Alphafold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) database (created by DeepMind and
EBI), [see "State-of-the-art protein modeling with Deep Learning-based methods"
module](ai.html).

Sequences with different detail of annotation can be found in two overlapping
and complementary databases in Uniprot:
[Uniparc](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc) and
[Uniref](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref). Briefly, UniParc (UniProt
Archive) is a comprehensive and non-redundant database that contains most of the
publicly available protein sequences in the world. UniParc avoided redundancy by
storing each unique sequence only once and giving it a stable and unique
identifier (**UPI**) making it possible to identify the same protein from
different source databases. A UPI is never removed, changed, or reassigned. On
the other hand, UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of
sequences from the UniprotKB (and selected UniParc records) in order to obtain
complete coverage of the sequence space at several resolutions while hiding
redundant sequences (but not their descriptions) from view. The UniRef100
database combines identical sequences into a single UniRef entry, displaying the
sequence of a representative protein, the accession numbers of all the merged
entries, and links to the corresponding. UniRef90 is built by clustering
UniRef100 sequences using the MMseqs2 algorithm [@steinegger2018] such that each
cluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% sequence identity and
80% overlap with the longest sequence (a.k.a. [**seed
sequence**](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref_seed) ) of the cluster.
Similarly, UniRef50 is built by clustering UniRef90 seed sequences that have at
least 50% sequence identity to and 80% overlap with the longest sequence in the
cluster. UniParc and Uniref contain only protein sequences. All other
information about the protein must be retrieved from the source databases using
the database cross-references.

### InterPro

[InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) aims to be a functional database, by
classifying proteins into families, domains, and important sites. To classify
proteins in this way, InterPro uses predictive models, known as signatures,
provided by several different databases (up to 13) that make up the InterPro
consortium. InterPro combines those different signatures representing equivalent
families, domains, or sites, and provides additional information such as
descriptions, literature references, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a
comprehensive resource for protein classification (see @blum2021).

InterPro database is updated every 2 months and it is very useful for
**annotation** of ORFans or divergent proteins.

### Pfam

Pfam is a protein database that aims to classify sequences by their evolutionary
relationships. It was founded in 1995 and it has been very useful for functional
annotation of genomic data. Pfam's website (<http://pfam.xfam.org/>) will be
closed by the end of 2022. However, Pfam database will not be discontinued but
integrated into the InterPro web site (see the [Xfam Blog
entry](https://xfam.wordpress.com/2022/08/04/pfam-website-decommission/)).

Pfam uses
[HMM](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/protein-classification-intro-ebi-resources/what-are-protein-signatures/signature-types/what-are-hmms/)
profiles (we will discuss HMMs in the [Homology Modeling](homology.qmd) module)
to classify proteins into families, which are grouped into clans. Check out the
EBI course about using Pfam:
<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/pfam-creating-protein-families/>

The current release (35.0) contains 19,632 entries (families and clans). Pfam
was designed as a database that should be often updated in the fast-forward
genomic era. To this aim, they use two alignment types. Each Pfam family has a
seed alignment that contains a representative set of sequences for the entry. A
profile hidden Markov model (HMM) is automatically built from the seed alignment
and searched against a sequence database called *pfamseq* using the HMMER3
software (<http://hmmer.org/>). All sequence regions that satisfy a
family-specific curated threshold, also known as the gathering threshold, are
aligned to the profile HMM to create the full alignment [@mistry2020].

In addition to the HMM-based Pfam entries (**Pfam-A**), are used to provide a
set of unannotated, computationally generated multiple sequence alignments
called **Pfam-B**. However, in the last Pfam versions, the Pfam-B alignments are
presently only released on the Pfam FTP site.

Pfam has also been used in the creation of other resources such as
[Rfam](https://rfam.org/) (RNA families) and [Dfam](https://www.dfam.org/)
(transposable DNA elements).

## Structure databases {#strDDBB}

### RCSB-PDB

The Protein Data Bank (PDB, [www.rcsb.org](www.rcsb.org)) database is the major
macromolecule structural database [@burley2021]. It contains mostly protein
structures, but also spans nucleic acids and nucleoprotein complexes. PDB turned
50 in 2021 and you can see a detailed overview of its [history in the RCSB-PDB
site.](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/history)

Briefly, the PDB was established in 1971 at Brookhaven National Laboratory with
only 7 structures. Then, the **Research Collaboratory for Structural
Bioinformatics** (RCSB), formed by Rutgers, UCSD/SDSC, and CARB/NIST, became
responsible for the management of the PDB in 1998 in response to an RFP and a
lengthy review process.¬†In 2003, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank
([wwPDB](http://wwpdb.org/)) was formed to maintain a single PDB archive of
macromolecular structural data that is freely and publicly available to the
global community. It consists of organizations that act as deposition, data
processing and distribution centers for PDB data.

PDB structures are largely obtained by X-ray crystallography, but it accepts
derived from EM and RMN data since 1989 and 1991, respectively. Indeed, the BMRB
([Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank](https://bmrb.io/)) has partnered with the
PDB since 2006 and the EMBD ([Electron Microscopy Data
Bank](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/)) since 2021. Furthermore, [starting September
2022](https://www.rcsb.org/news/6304ee57707ecd4f63b3d3db), the PDB also contains
computed models from the [Alphafold database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
(which we will discuss later in this course) and
[RoseTTAFold-ModelArchive](https://www.modelarchive.org/). **Thus, the PDB
database is the major hub that centralizes biological structures nowadays.**

PDB database has four mirrors and websites ([RCSB](www.rcsb.org),
[Europe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/), [BMRB](https://bmrb.io/), and
[Japan](https://pdbj.org/)) with mainly overlapping information, although they
have some specialization. The RCSB PDB site has also an educational section
([PDB-101](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/)) with very useful info and resources for
teaching and learning structural biology and the work with PDB structures.

The PDB entries contain all the information about the structure, spanning from
the protein sequence and source to the experiment details, as well as the
structure assessment (see [Structural quality assurance](pdb.html#sec-assess)
section) and visualization. You can download all this information and the
structure coordinates in diverse file formats.

### SCOP

The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP,
[http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk](http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)) database is a
*classification of protein domains* organized according to their evolutionary
and structural relationships in hierarchical categories. The main unit is the
*family* that groups related proteins with clear evidence for their evolutionary
origin while the *superfamily* brings together more distantly related protein
domains. Further, superfamilies are grouped into distinct *folds* on the basis
of the global structural features shared by the majority of their members.
Domain definitions are provided for the two main levels of the SCOP
classification, family and superfamily, and the domain boundaries for each of
these can coincide or differ [@andreeva2020].

For each group, a representative is selected based on its sequence (UniProtKB)
and structure (PDB) and used for SCOP classification. Thus, the SCOP domain
boundaries are assigned to both, the PDB and UniProtKB entry.

### CATH

CATH ([www.cathdb.info](www.cathdb.info)) is a free, publicly available resource
that identifies protein domains within proteins from the Protein Data Bank and
classifies them into evolutionary-related groups according to sequence,
structure, and function information. It assumes that related proteins which fold
alike often exhibit similar functions (this only could be demonstrated if we
find intermediates). CATH uses a hierarchical classification scheme where the
units compared and classified are structural domains. Domains, defined here as
globular structural domains capable of semi-independent folding, are extracted
from experimentally determined protein structures available in the PDB database.
The domains are classified into the following hierarchical levels that compose
the CATH name: Class (**C**), Architecture (**A**), Topology (**T**), and
Homologous superfamilies (**H**).

CATH uses a combination of several structure-based (SSAP, CATHEDRAL) and
sequence-based (Needleman-Wunsch-based sequence alignments, Jackhmmer, Profile
Comparer, and HHsearch) algorithms to assess the similarity of domains to each
other and to identify protein homologues [@sillitoe2021].

CATH has a sister resource, Gene3D, that adds in additional protein domain
sequences with no known structure, which brings the current total number of
domains in CATH-Gene3D up to 95 million.

CATH database is updated quite regularly through daily snapshots (CATH-B), but a
full release with more tools, named CATH+ is released every 12 months. CATH-plus
contains functional families (CATH-FunFams), structural clusters, and other
tools [@sillitoe2021].

Remember to work on groups as assigned. Groups should be the same for all the
course exercises.

## Classify the following protein structures into "groups" and "subgroups"

Focus only in structural databases (CATH, Scop2), but any given database can be
helpful in a different way. Use generic terms, valid for any hierarchical
classification, independent of the database(s) used.
