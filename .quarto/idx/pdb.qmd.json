Yes,\nindeed! It is actually the painting of a pipe.\n\nSimilarly, a picture of a protein, or a PDB file with the coordinates of a\nprotein structure, is not a protein. It is a representation of ONE possible structure of that protein.\nEven experimentally determined structures have two main limitations that we\nshould always keep in mind: (1) they are a fixed structure (except RMN-based) whereas proteins *in\nvivo* are flexible and dynamic and (2) they are subjected to experimental error\nand they often contain regions of low reliability (see below @sec-assess).\nMoreover, even experimentally obtained macromolecular structures are to some\ndegree models, with a variable ratio between experimental data and computational\nprediction to match the experimental data (X-ray diffraction, cryo-EM density\nmaps, NMR, SAXS, FRET...) with previously known structures or prediction models.\nObviously, that does not mean that protein structures are useless, they can be\nvery useful, but we must be aware of the limitations as well as the\napplications.\n\n# Experimental determination of protein structures\n\nThe structure helps to understand the molecular mechanism of protein function at\na higher level of detail. The 3D representation can help to orientate different\ndomains/motifs/residues of interest. This can be essential to understand the\nanalysis of population or pathogenic variants, drug design, and protein\nengineering. Moreover, the structures can also help to predict protein function\nand evolution, as they are more conserved than sequence, i.e., the protein\nstructure space is smaller than the sequence space. However, obtaining detailed\nand reliable structural data can be technically difficult and time-consuming\nand, as we will see, modeling protein structures can be often a good complement\nor alternative. Experimentally-obtained structures usually rely on three\nalternative techniques, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (RMN),\nor electron cryomicroscopy (CryoEM).\n\n## X-Ray crystallography or single crystal X-ray diffraction\n\nThe X-Ray crystallography or single crystal X-ray diffraction is a method to\ndetermine the atomic structure of molecules in regular, crystalline structures.\nIt requires the generation of a crystal of the molecule of interest that is then\nmounted on a goniometer and illuminated or irradiated with a focused beam of\nX-rays. The diffraction pattern of the X-rays at the other side of the crystal\nallow the determination of the atoms positions, as well as their chemical bonds,\ntheir crystallographic disorder, and various other information. However, the\nlink between the diffraction pattern and the electron density is not trivial and\nrequires some complex maths, called [Fourier\ntransforms](http://pruffle.mit.edu/atomiccontrol/education/xray/fourier.php).\n\n![Schematic workflow of X-ray crystallography. From Creative Structure\n[website](https://www.creative-biostructure.com/comparison-of-crystallography-nmr-and-em_6.htm).](images/paste-F430F5B1.png){#fig-xray\n.figure}\n\nX-ray is a powerful method that allows obtaining high-resolution structures at\nthe atomic level of soluble or membrane proteins, either as an apoenzyme or as a\nholoenzyme bound to substrate, cofactor or drugs. However, the sample must be\ncrystallizable (i.e. homogeneous), which requires quite an amount of very pure\nprotein. Another con of X-ray structures is that, as mentioned, you only obtain\none (or very few) static forms of the protein and the location of hydrogen atoms\ncannot be determined by conventional diffraction methods—the fact that they have only one electron—makes them very hard to detect with x-rays accurately because x-rays scatter from the electron density. They can be predicted, but that still hinders some chemical\nanalysis.\n\n## Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\n\nAll atomic nuclei are charged, fast spinning particles, which gave rise to\nresonance frequencies that are different for each atom. Therefore, if we apply a\nmagnetic field we can obtain an electromagnetic signal with a frequency\ncharacteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus. That is the basis of\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).\n\nAlso, we should consider that the movement of the nucleus is not isolated--it\ninteracts with the surrounding atoms both intra- and inter-molecularly. Thus,\nthrough nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, structural information of a\ngiven molecule can be obtained. Taking protein as an example, its secondary\nstructure, such as α-helix, β-sheet, turn, circular, and curl, reflect the\ndifferent arrangement of the main chain atoms of protein molecules\nthree-dimensionally. The spacing of the atomic nuclei in different secondary\ndomains, the interaction between nuclei, and the dynamic characteristics of\npolypeptide segments all directly reflect the three-dimensional structure of\nproteins. These nuclear features all contribute to spectroscopic behaviors of\nthe analyzed sample, thus providing characteristic NMR signals. Interpretation\nof these signals by computer-aided methods leads to deciphering of the\nthree-dimensional structure.\n\n![Basis of nuclear magnetic resonance. From Creative Structure\n[website](https://www.creative-biostructure.com/comparison-of-crystallography-nmr-and-em_6.htm).](images/paste-2013F0AC.png){#fig-rmn\n.figure}\n\nThe most important feature of the NMR method is that the three-dimensional\nstructure of macromolecules in the natural state can be measured directly in\nsolution, and NMR may provide unique information about dynamics and\nintermolecular interactions. The resolution of the macromolecular\nthree-dimensional structure can be as low as sub nanometer. However, the NMR\nspectrum of biomolecules with large molecular weight is very complicated and\ndifficult to interpret, thereby limiting the application of NMR in analyzing\nlarge biomolecules, often below 20-30 kDa (see @fig-experimental). Additionally,\nthis technique requires relatively large amounts of pure samples (on the order\nof several mg) to achieve a reasonable signal to noise level.\n\n[![Coverage of molecular weight by structural technique. From @hancock2022\n.](images/paste-FA73AF1E.png){#fig-experimental\n.figure}](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2022.107841)\n\n## Electron cryomicroscopy\n\nThe essential mechanism of Cryo-EM is the same of any electron microscopy\nmethod, i. e., electron scattering. Samples are prepared through\ncryopreservation prior to analysis. The coherent electrons are used as a light\nsource to measure the sample. After the electron beam passes through the sample,\na complex lens system converts the scattered signal into a magnified image\nrecorded on the detector. A key subsequent step is signal processing, that\ntransform thousands of images of the particles in any orientation into a\nthree-dimensional structure of the sample.\n\n![The process of Cryo-EM single particle analysis technique.

The\nnumber of protein structures being determined by cryo-electron microscopy is\ngrowing at an explosive rate in the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to several\ntechnical improvements in the technique, spanning sample preparation, analysis\nand processing that allow obtaining pictures at the atomic level\n[@callaway2020].

And\n[here](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/explainer-what-is-cryo-electron-microscopy/3008091.article)\nfor a great outreaching article after the Nobel Prize.\n:::\n\nCryoEM is widely use nowadays because, particularly for large molecular\ncomplexes or viral particles. Structures can be generated quickly, as it does\nnot require a high amount of protein and it can generate good data even in the\npresence of impurities. However, new generation microscopes are only affordable\nby large institutions and small particles can have a high level of noise.\nMoreover, processing a large amount of images can be limiting to obtain\nhigh-quality structures.\n\n# Structural quality assurance {#sec-assess}\n\nAs outlined at the beginning of this section, regardless of the origin or\ndetermination method, any structure is subjected to error. Experimentally-based\nstructures are actually models that match with the data. The quality of the\noriginal data and the care with which the experiments have been performed will\ndetermine the reliability of the structural results. As in any other scientific\ndiscipline, independently performed experiments can arrive to related models of\nthe same molecule but almost always there are differences; however both can be\ngood models.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Extra info\n\nCheck the detailed documentation about PDB validation report\n[here](https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/XrayValidationReportHelp).\n:::\n\n## Global parameters in experimentally-based structures\n\nThere are a number of diverse parameters that help us to understand the quality\nand reliability of an structure. First, the **resolution** is a good indicator\nof the level of detail of the structure, as it can strongly affect affect how\nthe experimental data is modeled.\n\n![The effect of resolution on the quality of the electron density. The Tyr100\nresidue from concanavalin A as found in the indicated PDB structures at 3 Å, 2 Å\nand 1.2 Å. Picture inspired in Figure 14.5 from @structur and rendered with\nPymol (see [concanavalin.pse](../concanavalin.pse) and\n[concanavalin.txt](../concanavalin.txt) in the Repo for details about the\npicture display).](images/paste-C3031EBE.png){#fig-reso .figure}\n\nOther important parameter is the ***R*****-factor**, which assess the difference between the structure factors calculated from the model and those obtained from\nthe experimental data. This is, the *R*-factor is the deviation of the\ncalculated diffraction pattern of the model and the original experimental\ndiffraction pattern. Typically, good structures with a resolution around 1-3 Å,\nwill have an *R-*factor of 0.2 (i.e., 20% of deviation). However, it should be\nnoted that this factor is usually reduced after iterative refinement, which\ndownplays its use as an indicative of reliability. A more reliable factor is the\n***R~free~***. This is less susceptible to manipulation during refinement, as it\nis based only in a small fraction of the experimental data (5-10%) that is not\nused throughout the refinement stage.\n\nA more intuitive, but only qualitative, way of understand the presicion of a\ngiven atom's coordinates is the *B-*factor. The temperature value or *B-*factor\ncorrelates with the positional errors, although its mathematical definition is\nmore complex. Normal values for a B-factor are within the range 14-30, whereas\nvalues above 30 usually indicate that the atom is within a flexible or\ndisordered region, and atoms with a *B-*factor over 40 are often excluded as\nbeing too unreliable.\n\nThe root-mean-squared deviation (**RMSD,** [see Structure alignment\nsection](ddbb.html#sec-alignment)) is a traditional estimator of the quality of\nNMR-solved structures. Regions with high RMSD values are those that are less\ndefined by data. However, it should be also noted that this parameter can be\nalso misleading as it is highly dependent on the procedure used to generate the\nand selection the data that is submitted to the PDB. An experimentalist could\nreduce the RMSD by choosing the \"best\" few structures for deposition from a much\nlarger draft. Note that the RMSD has many other applications, like comparing\ndifferent structures or models from the same or related sequences.\n\nIn the last years, along with the boost in quantity and quality of EM\nstructures, new parameters have been proposed. One of them, the\n***Q-*****factor** has been recently implemented for [validation of 3DEM/PDB\nstructures](https://www.rcsb.org/news/feature/62de9e5235ec5bb4ddb19a43).\nBriefly, the Q-score calculates the resolvability of atoms by measuring\nsimilarity of the map values around each atom relative to a Gaussian-like\nfunction for a well resolved atom. Q-score of 1 indicates that the similarity is\nperfect whilst closer to 0 indicates the similarity is low. If the atom is not\nwell placed in the map then a negative Q-score value may be reported. Therefore,\nQ-score values in the reports will be in a range of -1 to +1.\n\n## Stereochemical parameters\n\nGiven that all structural models contain some degree of error and some of the\nmodeling global parameters can be controversial, we can analyze the model's\ngeometry, stereochemistry, and other structural properties to assess structural\nmodels (experimentally or computationally obtained). These parameters compare a\ngiven structure (protein or nucleic acid) against what is already known about\nthis kind of molecule, based on our knowledge from high-res structures. That\nmeans that the (best) structures in the current structural space define what is\n\"normal\" in a protein structure. The advantage of these analyses and derived\nparameters is that they do not consider the process that leads to the model,\nthey only consider the final product and its reliability. The main disadvantage\nis that the current structural space is biased to proteins of known function and\nwith biomedical or biotechnological interest.\n\nOne of the most common and powerful methods to asses the stereochemistry of a\nprotein is the [Ramachandran plot](intro.html#sec-rama), defined in 1963 and\nstill in use.\n\nAnother widely used analysis (and available for all PDB structures) is the side\n[chain torsion\nangles](https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/XrayValidationReportHelp#torsion_angles),\nusually measured as ***Side chain outliers**.* As outlined in the\n[Introduction](intro.html#sec-str), amino acid side chains also have some\npreferred conformations. Like the Ramachandran plot, a plot of the χ1-χ2 torsion\nangles can indicate problems with a protein model when angle values are outside\nof the high density values.\n\nBad contact or\n[clashes](https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/XrayValidationReportHelp#close_contacts)\nindicate a bad model. It is obvious that two atoms cannot be in the same (or\nvery close) spot. We can define this as a situation where two nonbonded atoms\nhave a center-to-center distance that is smaller than the sum of their van der\nWalls radii.\n\n# Protein structure display {#sec-apps}\n\n## Protein structure file formats\n\nExperimental structural data from different methods is stored in different file\nformats. For instance, crystallographic raw data is usually saved as `*.ccp4`\nfiles, but Cryo-EM or X-ray density maps can be stored in `*.mrc` or `*.mtz`\nfiles. Other complex file formats, such as the Extensible Markup Language\n`*.xml`, provide a framework for structure complex information and documents\nlike protein structures.\n\nAlong with the establishment of the PDB, a simple format was developed. The PDB\nformat consist of a collection of fixed format records that describe the atomic\ncoordinates, chemical and biochemical features, experimental details of the\nstructure determination, and some structural features such as secondary\nstructure assignments, hydrogen bonding, or active sites. The current version is\nnamed PDBx/mmCIF)also incorporates the expanded crystallographic information\nfile format (mmCIF), allowing the representation of large structures, complex\nchemistry, and new and hybrid experimental methods. Thus a `*.pdb` and `*.cif`\nfiles can be considered as identical files.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Tip\n\nCheck PDB-101 course about PDBx/mmCIF format\n[here](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-pdb-structures-and-the-pdbx-mmcif-format).\n:::\n\n![Coordinates in the PDB file (6KI3)](images/paste-96FF761D.png){#fig-PDBfile\n.figure}\n\n### Occupancy and B-factor\n\nDisregarding the repetition of atom type in the rightmost column, the last\ncolumns in the PDB file are the **Occupancy** and the **temperature factor** or\nthe **B-factor**.\n\nMacromolecular crystals are composed of many individual molecules packed into a\nsymmetrical arrangement. In some crystals, there are slight differences between\neach of these molecules. For instance, a sidechain on the surface may wag back\nand forth between several conformations, or a substrate may bind in two\norientations in an active site, or a metal ion may be bound to only a few of the\nmolecules. When researchers build the atomic model of these portions, they can\nuse the occupancy to estimate the amount of each conformation that is observed\nin the crystal.\n\nThus, by definition, the sum of **occupancy** values for each atom must be 1.\nUsually, we will see a single record for an atom, with an occupancy value of 1,\nindicating that the atom is found in all of the molecules in the same place in\nthe crystal. However, if a metal ion binds to only half of the molecules in the\ncrystal, the researcher will see a weak image of the ion in the electron density\nmap, and can assign an occupancy of 0.5 in the PDB structure file for this atom.\nTwo (or more) atom records are included for each atom, with occupancies like 0.5\nand 0.5, or 0.4 and 0.6, or other fractional occupancies that sum to a total of\n1.\n\nOn the other hand, **temperature value or *B*-factor is** a measure of our\nconfidence in the location of each atom, as discussed above (@sec-assess). If\nyou find an atom on the surface of a protein with a high temperature factor,\nkeep in mind that this atom is probably moving a lot, and that the coordinates\nspecified in the PDB file are only one possible snapshot of its location. Thus,\nan atom record with an occupancy \\<1 can have a low B-factor if that position is\ncertain.\n\nAs you can imagine, this column is also used by computationally-derived models\nto include a confidence value.\n\n## Biological macromolecules display applications\n\n### PyMOL\n\n[PyMOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyMOL) is a very powerful molecular\nvisualization system written originally by [Warren\nDeLano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Lyford_DeLano). It was released in\n2000 and soon became very popular. It's currently commercialized under License\nby [Schrödinger](https://pymol.org/) but a free license for teaching can be\nrequested. Also, open source code is available on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source) that can be installed\non Linux or MAC. More info on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyMOL).\nYou can also check this quick [Reference\nguide](https://www.uml.edu/docs/PyMOL%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide_tcm18-230352.pdf)\n\nPyMOL allows working with different structures representation, but also with raw\nexperimental data in different\n[formats](https://pymol.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=format).\n\nPyMOL is written in Python and can be used with interactive menus and also with\ncommand line. There are a lot of resources that can help you with PyMOL, like a\n[Documentation Reference Wiki](https://pymol.org/dokuwiki/) or a\ncommunity-supported [PyMOLWiki](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page).\nMoreover, it allows the implementation of new functionalities as plugins, like\n[PyMod](http://schubert.bio.uniroma1.it/pymod/index.html) or\n[DockingPie](http://schubert.bio.uniroma1.it/dockingpie/index.html), among\nothers. [PyMod](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/PyMod) [@janson2021] is designed\nto act as simple and intuitive interface between PyMOL and several\nbioinformatics tools (i.e., PSI-BLAST, Clustal Omega, HMMER, MUSCLE, CAMPO,\nPSIPRED, and MODELLER). Starting from the amino acid sequence of the target\nprotein, PyMod is designed to carry out the main steps of the homology modeling\nprocess (that is, template searching, target-template sequence alignment and\nmodel building) in order to build a 3D atomic model of a target protein (or\nprotein complex). The integration with PyMOL facilitates a detailed analysis of\nthe modeling process.\n\nFinally, as any Python-based program, it can be used within Jupyter notebooks\n(see <https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs/2021/02/09354947/1rgCkrAJCko>).\n\n### UCSF ChimeraX\n\n[ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) [@pettersen2021] is a fully open\nsource software, developed by the UCSF as a renovated version of the former\n[Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) software, with versions for Linux,\nMacOS, and Windows. It aims to be a comprehensive structural biology tool, but\nit is more widely known for its capacities for EM maps. As any other open source\nsoftware, it has gained new and exciting capacities in the last years, like\n[Virtual Reality\ncapabilities](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/vr.html) or\n[Alphafold2](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/alphafold-nov2021/af_sbgrid.html)\nmodeling.\n\n### LiteMol and others\n\n[LiteMol Viewer](https://www.litemol.org/Viewer) is a powerful HTML5 web\napplication for 3D visualization of molecules and other related data. It is used\nin a web browser, eliminating the need for external software and also allowing\nthe integration with third-party sites as an embedded plugin, as it is in the\n[PDBe site](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/litemol).

The spacing of the atomic nuclei in different secondary\ndomains, the interaction between nuclei, and the dynamic characteristics of\npolypeptide segments all directly reflect the three-dimensional structure of\nproteins. These nuclear features all contribute to spectroscopic behaviors of\nthe analyzed sample, thus providing characteristic NMR signals. Interpretation\nof these signals by computer-aided methods leads to deciphering of the\nthree-dimensional structure.\n\n![Basis of nuclear magnetic resonance.

The resolution of the macromolecular\nthree-dimensional structure can be as low as sub nanometer. However, the NMR\nspectrum of biomolecules with large molecular weight is very complicated and\ndifficult to interpret, thereby limiting the application of NMR in analyzing\nlarge biomolecules, often below 20-30 kDa (see @fig-experimental). Additionally,\nthis technique requires relatively large amounts of pure samples (on the order\nof several mg) to achieve a reasonable signal to noise level.\n\n[![Coverage of molecular weight by structural technique.

Samples are prepared through\ncryopreservation prior to analysis. The coherent electrons are used as a light\nsource to measure the sample. After the electron beam passes through the sample,\na complex lens system converts the scattered signal into a magnified image\nrecorded on the detector. A key subsequent step is signal processing, that\ntransform thousands of images of the particles in any orientation into a\nthree-dimensional structure of the sample.\n\n![The process of Cryo-EM single particle analysis technique.

The\nnumber of protein structures being determined by cryo-electron microscopy is\ngrowing at an explosive rate in the last 5-10 years.

And\n[here](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/explainer-what-is-cryo-electron-microscopy/3008091.article)\nfor a great outreaching article after the Nobel Prize.\n:::\n\nCryoEM is widely use nowadays because, particularly for large molecular\ncomplexes or viral particles. Structures can be generated quickly, as it does\nnot require a high amount of protein and it can generate good data even in the\npresence of impurities. However, new generation microscopes are only affordable\nby large institutions and small particles can have a high level of noise.\nMoreover, processing a large amount of images can be limiting to obtain\nhigh-quality structures.\n\n# Structural quality assurance {#sec-assess}\n\nAs outlined at the beginning of this section, regardless of the origin or\ndetermination method, any structure is subjected to error. Experimentally-based\nstructures are actually models that match with the data. The quality of the\noriginal data and the care with which the experiments have been performed will\ndetermine the reliability of the structural results. As in any other scientific\ndiscipline, independently performed experiments can arrive to related models of\nthe same molecule but almost always there are differences; however both can be\ngood models.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Extra info\n\nCheck the detailed documentation about PDB validation report\n[here](https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/XrayValidationReportHelp).\n:::\n\n## Global parameters in experimentally-based structures\n\nThere are a number of diverse parameters that help us to understand the quality\nand reliability of an structure. First, the **resolution** is a good indicator\nof the level of detail of the structure, as it can strongly affect affect how\nthe experimental data is modeled.\n\n![The effect of resolution on the quality of the electron density. The Tyr100\nresidue from concanavalin A as found in the indicated PDB structures at 3 Å, 2 Å\nand 1.2 Å. Picture inspired in Figure 14.5 from @structur and rendered with\nPymol (see [concanavalin.pse](../concanavalin.pse) and\n[concanavalin.txt](../concanavalin.txt) in the Repo for details about the\npicture display).](images/paste-C3031EBE.png){#fig-reso .figure}\n\nOther important parameter is the ***R*****-factor**, which assess the difference between the structure factors calculated from the model and those obtained from\nthe experimental data. This is, the *R*-factor is the deviation of the\ncalculated diffraction pattern of the model and the original experimental\ndiffraction pattern. Typically, good structures with a resolution around 1-3 Å,\nwill have an *R-*factor of 0.2 (i.e., 20% of deviation). However, it should be\nnoted that this factor is usually reduced after iterative refinement, which\ndownplays its use as an indicative of reliability. A more reliable factor is the\n***R~free~***. This is less susceptible to manipulation during refinement, as it\nis based only in a small fraction of the experimental data (5-10%) that is not\nused throughout the refinement stage.\n\nA more intuitive, but only qualitative, way of understand the presicion of a\ngiven atom's coordinates is the *B-*factor. The temperature value or *B-*factor\ncorrelates with the positional errors, although its mathematical definition is\nmore complex. Normal values for a B-factor are within the range 14-30, whereas\nvalues above 30 usually indicate that the atom is within a flexible or\ndisordered region, and atoms with a *B-*factor over 40 are often excluded as\nbeing too unreliable.\n\nThe root-mean-squared deviation (**RMSD,** [see Structure alignment\nsection](ddbb.html#sec-alignment)) is a traditional estimator of the quality of\nNMR-solved structures. Regions with high RMSD values are those that are less\ndefined by data. However, it should be also noted that this parameter can be\nalso misleading as it is highly dependent on the procedure used to generate the\nand selection the data that is submitted to the PDB. An experimentalist could\nreduce the RMSD by choosing the \"best\" few structures for deposition from a much\nlarger draft. Note that the RMSD has many other applications, like comparing\ndifferent structures or models from the same or related sequences.\n\nIn the last years, along with the boost in quantity and quality of EM\nstructures, new parameters have been proposed. One of them, the\n***Q-*****factor** has been recently implemented for [validation of 3DEM/PDB\nstructures](https://www.rcsb.org/news/feature/62de9e5235ec5bb4ddb19a43).\nBriefly, the Q-score calculates the resolvability of atoms by measuring\nsimilarity of the map values around each atom relative to a Gaussian-like\nfunction for a well resolved atom. Q-score of 1 indicates that the similarity is\nperfect whilst closer to 0 indicates the similarity is low. If the atom is not\nwell placed in the map then a negative Q-score value may be reported. Therefore,\nQ-score values in the reports will be in a range of -1 to +1.\n\n## Stereochemical parameters\n\nGiven that all structural models contain some degree of error and some of the\nmodeling global parameters can be controversial, we can analyze the model's\ngeometry, stereochemistry, and other structural properties to assess structural\nmodels (experimentally or computationally obtained). These parameters compare a\ngiven structure (protein or nucleic acid) against what is already known about\nthis kind of molecule, based on our knowledge from high-res structures. That\nmeans that the (best) structures in the current structural space define what is\n\"normal\" in a protein structure. The advantage of these analyses and derived\nparameters is that they do not consider the process that leads to the model,\nthey only consider the final product and its reliability. The main disadvantage\nis that the current structural space is biased to proteins of known function and\nwith biomedical or biotechnological interest.\n\nOne of the most common and powerful methods to asses the stereochemistry of a\nprotein is the [Ramachandran plot](intro.html#sec-rama), defined in 1963 and\nstill in use.\n\nAnother widely used analysis (and available for all PDB structures) is the side\n[chain torsion\nangles](https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/XrayValidationReportHelp#torsion_angles),\nusually measured as ***Side chain outliers**.* As outlined in the\n[Introduction](intro.html#sec-str), amino acid side chains also have some\npreferred conformations. Like the Ramachandran plot, a plot of the χ1-χ2 torsion\nangles can indicate problems with a protein model when angle values are outside\nof the high density values.\n\nBad contact or\n[clashes](https://www.wwpdb.org/validation/XrayValidationReportHelp#close_contacts)\nindicate a bad model. It is obvious that two atoms cannot be in the same (or\nvery close) spot. We can define this as a situation where two nonbonded atoms\nhave a center-to-center distance that is smaller than the sum of their van der\nWalls radii.\n\n# Protein structure display {#sec-apps}\n\n## Protein structure file formats\n\nExperimental structural data from different methods is stored in different file\nformats. For instance, crystallographic raw data is usually saved as `*.ccp4`\nfiles, but Cryo-EM or X-ray density maps can be stored in `*.mrc` or `*.mtz`\nfiles. Other complex file formats, such as the Extensible Markup Language\n`*.xml`, provide a framework for structure complex information and documents\nlike protein structures.\n\nAlong with the establishment of the PDB, a simple format was developed. The PDB\nformat consist of a collection of fixed format records that describe the atomic\ncoordinates, chemical and biochemical features, experimental details of the\nstructure determination, and some structural features such as secondary\nstructure assignments, hydrogen bonding, or active sites. The current version is\nnamed PDBx/mmCIF)also incorporates the expanded crystallographic information\nfile format (mmCIF), allowing the representation of large structures, complex\nchemistry, and new and hybrid experimental methods. Thus a `*.pdb` and `*.cif`\nfiles can be considered as identical files.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n### Tip\n\nCheck PDB-101 course about PDBx/mmCIF format\n[here](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-pdb-structures-and-the-pdbx-mmcif-format).\n:::\n\n![Coordinates in the PDB file (6KI3)](images/paste-96FF761D.png){#fig-PDBfile\n.figure}\n\n### Occupancy and B-factor\n\nDisregarding the repetition of atom type in the rightmost column, the last\ncolumns in the PDB file are the **Occupancy** and the **temperature factor** or\nthe **B-factor**.\n\nMacromolecular crystals are composed of many individual molecules packed into a\nsymmetrical arrangement. In some crystals, there are slight differences between\neach of these molecules. For instance, a sidechain on the surface may wag back\nand forth between several conformations, or a substrate may bind in two\norientations in an active site, or a metal ion may be bound to only a few of the\nmolecules. When researchers build the atomic model of these portions, they can\nuse the occupancy to estimate the amount of each conformation that is observed\nin the crystal.\n\nThus, by definition, the sum of **occupancy** values for each atom must be 1.\nUsually, we will see a single record for an atom, with an occupancy value of 1,\nindicating that the atom is found in all of the molecules in the same place in\nthe crystal. However, if a metal ion binds to only half of the molecules in the\ncrystal, the researcher will see a weak image of the ion in the electron density\nmap, and can assign an occupancy of 0.5 in the PDB structure file for this atom.\nTwo (or more) atom records are included for each atom, with occupancies like 0.5\nand 0.5, or 0.4 and 0.6, or other fractional occupancies that sum to a total of\n1.\n\nOn the other hand, **temperature value or *B*-factor is** a measure of our\nconfidence in the location of each atom, as discussed above (@sec-assess). If\nyou find an atom on the surface of a protein with a high temperature factor,\nkeep in mind that this atom is probably moving a lot, and that the coordinates\nspecified in the PDB file are only one possible snapshot of its location. Thus,\nan atom record with an occupancy \\<1 can have a low B-factor if that position is\ncertain.\n\nAs you can imagine, this column is also used by computationally-derived models\nto include a confidence value.\n\n## Biological macromolecules display applications\n\n### PyMOL\n\n[PyMOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyMOL) is a very powerful molecular\nvisualization system written originally by [Warren\nDeLano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Lyford_DeLano). It was released in\n2000 and soon became very popular. It's currently commercialized under License\nby [Schrödinger](https://pymol.org/) but a free license for teaching can be\nrequested. Also, open source code is available on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source) that can be installed\non Linux or MAC. More info on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyMOL).\nYou can also check this quick [Reference\nguide](https://www.uml.edu/docs/PyMOL%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide_tcm18-230352.pdf)\n\nPyMOL allows working with different structures representation, but also with raw\nexperimental data in different\n[formats](https://pymol.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=format).\n\nPyMOL is written in Python and can be used with interactive menus and also with\ncommand line. There are a lot of resources that can help you with PyMOL, like a\n[Documentation Reference Wiki](https://pymol.org/dokuwiki/) or a\ncommunity-supported [PyMOLWiki](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page).\nMoreover, it allows the implementation of new functionalities as plugins, like\n[PyMod](http://schubert.bio.uniroma1.it/pymod/index.html) or\n[DockingPie](http://schubert.bio.uniroma1.it/dockingpie/index.html), among\nothers. [PyMod](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/PyMod) [@janson2021] is designed\nto act as simple and intuitive interface between PyMOL and several\nbioinformatics tools (i.e., PSI-BLAST, Clustal Omega, HMMER, MUSCLE, CAMPO,\nPSIPRED, and MODELLER). Starting from the amino acid sequence of the target\nprotein, PyMod is designed to carry out the main steps of the homology modeling\nprocess (that is, template searching, target-template sequence alignment and\nmodel building) in order to build a 3D atomic model of a target protein (or\nprotein complex). The integration with PyMOL facilitates a detailed analysis of\nthe modeling process.\n\nFinally, as any Python-based program, it can be used within Jupyter notebooks\n(see <https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs/2021/02/09354947/1rgCkrAJCko>).\n\n### UCSF ChimeraX\n\n[ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) [@pettersen2021] is a fully open\nsource software, developed by the UCSF as a renovated version of the former\n[Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) software, with versions for Linux,\nMacOS, and Windows. It aims to be a comprehensive structural biology tool, but\nit is more widely known for its capacities for EM maps. As any other open source\nsoftware, it has gained new and exciting capacities in the last years, like\n[Virtual Reality\ncapabilities](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/vr.html) or\n[Alphafold2](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/data/alphafold-nov2021/af_sbgrid.html)\nmodeling.\n\n### LiteMol and others\n\n[LiteMol Viewer](https://www.litemol.org/Viewer) is a powerful HTML5 web\napplication for 3D visualization of molecules and other related data. It is used\nin a web browser, eliminating the need for external software and also allowing\nthe integration with third-party sites as an embedded plugin, as it is in the\n[PDBe site](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/litemol). More information about LiteMol\ncan be found on @sehnal2017, the\n[wiki](https://webchem.ncbr.muni.cz/Wiki/LiteMol:UserManual), or [YouTube\ntutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRoyYUeP1hdH2r8XUW-WMoA).\n\nThe same phylosopy applies to other open-source viewers like [NGL\nViewer](https://nglviewer.org/) and [Mol\\*](https://molstar.org/). However,\nsince LiteMol was developed by the EMBL-EBI and it is used in ePDB site, it has\nbecome more popular.\n\nOther applications that you may know or came into are:\n\n-   SwissPDBViewer (aka DeepView), developed to work with SWISS-MODEL homology\n    modeling app, is an application that provides a user-friendly interface\n    allowing to analyze several proteins at the same time. It has currently\n    fallen in disuse as the last version (4.1) is only a 32 bits application.\n\n-   RasMol and OpenRasMol were developed initially in 1992 and its last release\n    was in 2009. It was a pioneer as a simple molecular display open-source\n    application, but it is outdated nowadays.\n\n# [**PyMOL Practice**]{style=\"color:green\"}\n\nOur PyMOL Practice has two parts.\n\n## [PART A: A 10-steps self-guided practice](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s62/sh/666c39a1-ac03-64c9-b8a0-cab9ff3959c7/9d20b6eadae8d130fdbe6652d60237f2)\n\nThis is a [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/es) note that you can consult\nonline and also copy into your Evenote account if you wish.\n\n## PART B: PyMOL Challenge\n\nMake a ready-to-publish picture of your favorite protein.
