Thus,\ndespite substantial efforts that started at the beginning of the 21st century to\nimplement high-throughput structural biology methods [see for instance\n@manjasetty2008], the availability of protein structures is more than 1,000\ntimes less than the number of sequences (>226M sequences for Uniprot and ∽195k\nstructures in RCSB Protein Databank in August 2022). This difference is called\nthe *protein structure gap* and it is constantly widening [@muhammed2019].\n\n[![Number of macromolecular structures in RCSB PDB database (accessed 6th July\n2022).](pics/RCSB_stats.png \"Number of macromolecular structures in RCSB PDB database.\"){#fig-structures\n.figure}](https://www.rcsb.org/stats/growth/growth-released-structures)\n\nThus, an accurate prediction of the 3D structure of any given protein is needed\nto make up for the lack of experimental data.\n\n## Are protein structures predictable at all?\n\nAmino acid properties determine the phi and psi angles that eventually shape the\nhigher structural levels. Protein folding might be more complex though, as it\nshould be coupled to protein synthesis.\n\nOne can think that complexity and diversity of protein structures in the nature\nmay be huge. Indeed, upon their determination of the three-dimensional globular\nstructure (myoglobin, 1958), John Kendrew and his coworkers seemed very\ndisappointed [@kendrew1958]:\n\n*Perhaps the most remarkable features of the molecule are its complexity and its\nlack of symmetry. The arrangement seems to be almost totally lacking in the kind\nof regularities which one instinctively anticipates, and it is more complicated\nthat has been anticipated by any theory of protein structure.*\n\nNot much later, in 1968, Cyrus Levinthal (1922--1990) published the so-called\n*Levinthal's paradox*, stating that proteins fold in nano/milliseconds, but even\nfor small peptides it will take a huge time to test the astronomical number of\npossible conformations. Say a 100 aa small protein; it will have 99 peptidic\nbonds and 198 different phi and psi angles. Assuming only 3 alternative\nconformations for each bond, it will yield 3^198^ (= 2.95 x 10^95^) possible\nconformations. If we design a highly efficient algorithm that tests 1\nconformation per nanosecond:\n\n|  2.95 x 10^85^ secs = **9x10^67^ billions years**\n\nConsidering that the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years, predicting\nprotein structures does not seem an easy task.\n\nIn this context, a very simple experiment 50 years ago, led some light on the\nprotein folding mechanism. [Cristian\nAnfisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_B._Anfinsen) was able to\ncompletely denature (unfold) the Ribonuclease A, by the addition of reducing\nagents and urea under heat treatment, and subsequently switch to normal\nconditions that allow the protein to re-fold fully functional. This experiment\nindicates that the amino acid sequence dictates the final structure.\nNotwithstanding some relevant exceptions, this has been largely confirmed.\n\n![The Anfinsen Dogma: Amino acid sequence dictated the final structure. From\n@anfinsen1973 .](pics/anfinsen.jpg \"Anfinsen\"){#fig-anfinsen .figure}\n\nOne can imagine that *in vivo* native structures of proteins look-alike the\nlowest free energy conformation, i.e., the global energy minimum. That is the\nbasis of the funnel model of protein folding, which assumes that the number of\npossible conformations is reduced when a local energy minimum is achieved,\nconstituting a path for the folding process.\n\n[![Schematic diagram of a protein folding energy landscape according to the\nfunnel model. Denatured molecules at the top of the funnel might fold to the\nnative state by a myriad of different routes, some of which involve transient\nintermediates (local energy minima) whereas others involve significant kinetic\ntraps (misfolded states).

Basically, the strategy is adding all the possible extra information\nto the amino acid properties, namely the evolutionary conservation of sequences\nand structures.\n\nVery often, before generating models you already have some information about\nyour protein. For instance, if it is an enzyme you may have spotted the\ncatalytic residues or substrate-interaction region. It is also advisable to\ncheck the literature, particularly if there is a companion paper of the related\nPDB structure(s) that may be available or that you can eventually find and use\nas the template(s) for modeling.\n\n# Homology modeling: Conservation is the key\n\n![Protein modeling in a nutshell is about going from the sequence to the\nstructure. But, how do we do\nit?](pics/modeling.png \"Protein modeling\"){#fig-nutshell .figure}\n\nTraditionally and conceptually, the prediction of protein structures can be\naddressed from two different perspectives: comparative modeling and *ab initio*\nprediction. In the comparative modeling approach, one can predict 3D structure\nfor protein sequences only if their homologs are found in the database of\nproteins with known structures. Obviously, the identification of such homologs\nis the keyword here. Until recently, most of the evolution in protein modeling\nwas driven by the evolution of methods to identify distant sequence similarities\nthat would reflex similar protein folds.\n\n[![Two different approaches for structure\nprediction.](pics/predway.jpeg \"Two different approaches for structure prediction.\"){#fig-modelingways\n.figure}](http://isw3.naist.jp/IS/Bio-Info-Unit/gogroup/study/study-en.html)\n\nThe accuracy of homology modeling will be limited by the availability of similar\nstructures, *ab initio* predictions are limited by the mathematical models and\ncomputational resources, being often useful only with small peptides.\n\nTo maintain structure and function, certain amino acids in the protein sequence\nsuffer a stronger selective pressure, evolving either slower than expected or\nwithin specific constraints, such as chemical similarity (i.e., conservative\nsubstitutions). Thus, homology modeling approaches assume that a similar protein\nsequence involves a similar 3D structure and function. At the same time,\nalthough the number of published sequences and structures continually increased,\nthe number of unique folds remains almost steady since 2008.\n\n![Growth of the protein structure database since its inception in 1974. From\n[Bonvin lab\nsite](https://www.bonvinlab.org/education/molmod_online/modelling/).](pics/rcsb-statistics.png \"Protein structures and unique folds\"){#fig-bovin\n.figure}\n\nThat implies that the space of protein sequences is much larger than the space\nof structures. This has been exploited by some structural databases, like\n[Scop2](https://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/) or [CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/),\nthat use hierarchical classifications of structures into very few categories of\ndifferent structures.\n\n![[CATH](https://www.cathdb.info/) main categories exemplified the limited\nstructures space, with 86k vs 500k domains in 2006 and 2022, respectively, but\n40 and 41 architectures in the same years.](pics/cath.png \"CATH\"){#fig-cath\n.figure width=\"632\"}\n\nIn conclusion, protein structures are more conserved than sequences, which\nallows for model construction by comparison of related proteins. Biological\nsequences evolve through mutation and selection and selective pressure is\ndifferent for each residue position in a protein according to its structural and\nfunctional relevance. Sequence alignments attempt to tell us the evolutionary\nstory of proteins.\n\n# Homology modeling in four steps\n\n![Workflow of template-based protein modeling. From Expasy [Protein Structure,\nComparative Protein Modelling, and Visualisation online\ncourse](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/static/course/files/PartII_homology_modelling.pdf).](pics/homology_simple_workflow.png \"Homology Modeling workflow\"){#fig-modelingsteps\n.figure width=\"397\"}\n\nA basic workflow of homology modeling requires three steps: (1) identification\nof the best-suitable template, (2) alignment of the query sequence and the\ntemplate, and (3) construction of the model. These steps can be addressed with\ndiverse methodological alternatives and can provide different outputs that must\nbe assessed (step 4) in order to decide the best solution for each step. For a\nmore detailed review on homology modeling, I suggest reading @haddad2020.\n\nIn this course, we are focusing on end-to-end modeling with\n[SWISS-MODEL](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) [@waterhouse2018], a fully\nautomated modeling server that allows you the construction of models without the\nrequirement of a strong bioinformatics background or coding skills.\n\nSWISS-MODEL has different supported inputs. Usually, you provide a single\nsequence query for template searching, but you can bypass this step and provide\ndirectly the template you want to use and even a template and a custom\nalignment. We will start with the first alternative.\n\n#### [Homology Modeling Practice A: Quick Modeling with SWISS-MODEL.]{style=\"color:green\"}\n\nAs an exercise, we are modeling a human DNA repair protein, NEIL2, and a viral\nDNA polymerase (HAdV-2 pol). We will intersperse discussion about modeling with\nthe exercise steps.\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Rather than provide just a recipe to make a model in two clics, the goal is to understand the process behind, while doing exercises with selected examples\n:::\n\n## Step 1+2. Template search and align. {#template}\n\n### Where can we search?\n\nTemplate searching consists in finding a protein with known structure that has a\nsequence similar to our protein. As we mentioned above, the [RCSB Protein Data\nBank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB) is the largest database of protein\nstructures, so we can search templates by comparing the sequence of our protein\nwith the sequence of all the proteins in PDB. However, PDB was constructed to\ncontain all the macromolecular structures, not for searching templates for\nmodeling. Similar to other end-to-end software, SWISS-MODEL has its own curated\ndatabase, called **SMLT** (SWISS-MODEL template library). This is based on PDB,\nupdated weekly, and also annotated and indexed to boost searches. As of 6 July\n2022, SMLT contains 133,049 unique protein sequences that map to 332,864\nbiological units (protein structures classified by their quaternary structure).\n\nNow, you first need your sequences. A protein sequence database like\n[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/) or [NCBI\nProtein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/), is a good place for this task.\n\nIf you want to cheat yourself, I give you the\n[HAdV-2pol](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P03261.fasta) and\n[NEIL2](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q969S2.fasta) sequences.\n\n### How can we search accurately and fast?\n\n![Query-template alignment is the base for homology modeling\n[@kelley2009]](pics/template_query.png \"Query-template alignment is the base for a new model\"){#fig-query\n.figure width=\"631\"}\n\nFinding templates require comparing sequences, thus an accurate and powerful\nalignment method is essential. Comparing one protein sequence with a whole\ndatabase is time-consuming, as you will compare with totally unrelated proteins,\nwhich is a loss of resources. Two basic improvements increased the template\nsearch capacity, (1) the introduction of secondary structure (SS) by comparing\nSS predictions of the query protein and the secondary structures of the protein\ndatabase, and (2) the use of profiles to make easier the comparison.\n[Profiles](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/protein-classification-intro-ebi-resources/what-are-protein-signatures/signature-types/what-are-profiles/)\nare a mathematical way to summarize a multiple sequence alignment in which the\nfrequency of each amino acid at each position is quantified. A particular type\nof profiles, the [*Hidden Markov\nModels*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/protein-classification-intro-ebi-resources/what-are-protein-signatures/signature-types/what-are-hmms/)\n(HMM) are very well suited to search databases for similar sequences. HMMs\ninclude amino acid insertions and deletions, meaning that they can model entire\nalignments, including divergent regions. This allows the identification of\nhighly conserved positions that not only define the protein function but also\nthe fold. For instance, glycine residues at the end of each beta-strand or a\npattern of polar residues that favors alpha-helices. A previous comparison of\nthe query sequence with a database of sequences will allow us to include\nevolutionary information about it. Therefore, we moved from a requirement of\n\\>30% identity to obtain good models before the implementation of profiles, to\ngood models even with ⁓20% identity or below. Moreover, the generation of\nprofiles also facilitates clustering of the search database, reducing search\ntime. The implementation of these capacities led to the implementation of the\nso-called **fold recognition** in homology modeling.\n\n![From sequence vs. sequence search to profile-profile comparison\n[@kelley2009].](pics/profiles.jpg \"From sequence vs. sequence search to profile-profile comparison\"){#fig-profiles\n.figure width=\"669\"}\n\nTemplate searches in SWISS-MODEL have evolved through the years and currently,\nthis step is performed with HHblits [@remmert2011], a specific profile-profile\nmethod. We could search for templates also with Blast or other profile-profile\nmethods, like\n[Psi-BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&PROGRAM=blastp&BLAST_PROGRAMS=psiBlast),\n[HHPred](https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred), or\n[JackHMMER](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/search/jackhmmer). Then, templates\nare ranked by two different numeric parameters ranging between 0 and 1: **GMQE**\n(global model quality estimate) and **QSQE** (quaternary structure quality\nestimate). Briefly, GMQE uses probability functions to assess several properties\nof the target-template alignment (sequence identity, sequence similarity,\nHHblits score, the agreement between predicted secondary structure of target and\ntemplate, the agreement between predicted solvent accessibility between target\nand template; all normalized by alignment length) to predict the expected\nquality of the resulting model. QSQE assesses the oligomeric state probability\nof the model.\n\nNow, paste your sequences and click on Search.\n\nNote: If you click on \"Build Model\", it will directly use the top-ranked\ntemplate, so you'll miss some fun, but you can go back for that later on if you\nchange your mind.\n\n[![SWISS-MODEL modeling\nstart](pics/seach.png \"SWISS-MODEL modeling\"){#fig-swissmodel\n.figure}](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive)\n\n#### [Could you foresee which of our queries will give rise to a better model? Why?]{style=\"color:green\"}\n\n## Step 3. Model Building.\n\nBy default, SWISS-MODEL will provide 50 ranked possible templates. The output\nalso contains information about the method and resolution of the templates, the\n% of identity (and alignment coverage) with the query sequence, and the GMQE and\nQSQE.\n\nThe top template is marked by default and it likely will give the best model,\nbut it is also interesting to try some alternative templates depending on the\ndownstream application of the model (see [below](#corollary)). For instance with\na different substrate/cofactor that can have a key role in the protein function\nor with different coverage or % identity.\n\nOnce the template(s) is selected, model coordinates are constructed based on the\nalignment of the query and template sequence. SWISS-MODEL uses a fragment\nassembly, as well as\n[RosettaCM](https://new.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/rosetta_cm/rosetta_cm_tutorial),\nanother very well-known homology modeling algorithm by the [Baker\nlab](https://www.bakerlab.org/), implemented in\n[Rosetta](https://www.rosettacommons.org/software) software and the\n[Robetta](https://robetta.bakerlab.org/) server. Other programs, like\n[Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/), are based in the satisfaction of\nspatial restraints [@janson2019]. Like Rosetta, Modeller is a command-line tool\nthat allow a full customization of the modeling, which requires more knowledge\nabout the process but can be very useful for some types of proteins. However,\nboth methods have been implemented in some online servers and user-friendly\napplications.\n\nFragment assembly will use the template core backbone atoms to build a core\nstructure of the model, leaving non-conserved regions (mostly loops) for later.\nThen, it will find compatible fragments in a dedicated loop database and also\nuse *ab initio* building or missing loops.\n\n![Backbone and loop modeling. From [Expasy Protein Structure, Comparative\nProtein Modelling, and\nVisualisation](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/static/course/files/PartII_homology_modelling.pdf).](pics/loops.png \"Backbone and loop modeling\"){#fig-backbone\n.figure}\n\nThen, side chain of non conserved amino acids in undertook. The goal is findig\nthe most likely side chain conformation, using template structure information,\nrotamer libraries (from known protein structures) and energetic and packaging\ncriteria. If many side chains have to be placed in the structure it will lead to\na \"chicken and egg problem\". Thus, the more residues correctly positioned, the\nbest model. That means that identification of hydrogen bonds between residues\nside chains and between side chains and the backbone reduce the optimization\ncalculations.\n\n![Side chain modeling. From [CMBI Seminars on\nBioinformatics](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/teach/B1SEM/B1SEM_8.html).](pics/Rotamers.gif \"Backbone and loop modeling\"){#fig-rotamers\n.figure}\n\nFinally, a short energy minimization is carry out to reduce the unfavorable\ncontacts and bonds by adapting the angle geometries and relax close contacts.\nThis energy minimization step or refinement can be useful to achieve better\nmodels but only when the folding is already accurate.\n\n## Step 4. Result assessing.\n\nThe computer always give you a model but it doesn't mean that you have a model\nthat makes sense. How can we know if we can rely in the model? Output models are\ncolored in a temperature color scale, from navy blue (good quality) to red (bad\nquality). That can help us to understand our model in a first sight. Also, this\nis an interactive site and you can zoom-in, zoom-out the model. Many other\nfeatures are available to work on your model. For instance, you can compare\nmultiple models, you can change the display options. You can also download all\nthe files and reports on the \"Project Data\" button.\n\n[![NEIL2 model created with SWISS-MODEL (July\n2022)](pics/neil2.png \"NEIL2 model\"){#fig-neil\n.figure}](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive/TWq8LD/models/)\n\nThere is also a \"Structure Assessment\" option. This provide you a detailed\nreport of the structural problems of your model. You can see [Ramachandran\nplots](intro.html#sec-rama \"Ramachandran plots in Wikipedia\") that highlight in\nred the amino acid residues with abnormal phi/psi angles in the model and a\ndetailed list of other problems.\n\nThe GMQE is updated to the QMEAN Zscore and QMEANDisCo [@studer2020]. The QMEAN\nZ-score or the normalized QMEAN score indicates how the model is comparable to\nexperimental structures of similar size. A QMEAN Z-score around 0 indicates good\nagreement, while score below -4.0 are given to models of low quality. Besides\nthe number, a plot shows the QMEAN score of our model (red star) within all\nQMEAN scores of experimentally determined structures compared to their size.\nOverall, the Z-score is equivalent to the standard deviation of the mean.\n\n![Per-residue QMEANDisCo scores are mapped as red-to-green colour gradient on a\nmodel of lbp-8 in Caenorhabditis elegans (UniProtKB: O02324, PDB: 6C1Z).\nDistance constraints have been constructed from an ensemble of experimentally\ndetermined protein structures that are homologous to lbp-8.

From @studer2020.](images/paste-C2BED0C6.png){#fig-disco .figure\nwidth=\"572\"}\n\nThe QMEANDisCO was implemented in SWISS-MODEL in 2020 and it is a powerful,\nsingle parameter that combines statistical potentials and agreement terms with a\ndistance constraints (DisCo) to provide a consensus score. DisCo evaluates\nconsistencies of pairwise CA-CA distances from a model with constraints\nextracted from homologous structures. All scores are combined using a neural\nnetwork trained to predict per-residue scores. We can check a global score, but\nalso a local score for each residue, that help us to understand which regions of\nthe model are more likely to accurately folded (i.e. they are more reliable).\n\n[![HAdV-2 DNA polymerase model obtained with SWISS-MODEL (July\n2022).](pics/hadv-pol.png \"HAdV-2 DNA polymerase\"){#fig-pol\n.figure}](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive/GZ8GmU/models/)\n\nQMEANDisCo can be used to analyze models obtained with other methods in order to\nmake them comparable (note that you can use QMEANDisCo for models obtained with\nany method, you just need a `.pdb` file). There are other independent model\nassessing tools commonly used to assess protein models, like\n[VoroMQA](https://bioinformatics.lt/wtsam/voromqa) \\[@olechnovi2017\\] or\n[MoldFold](https://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/ModFOLD/ModFOLD8_form.html)\n[@mcguffin2021]. VoroMQA is very quick method that combines the idea of\nstatistical potentials (i.e. a knowledge-based score function) with the use of\ninteratomic contact areas to provide a score in the range of \\[0,1\\]. When\napplied to PDB database, most of the high-quality experimentally-based\nstructures have a VoroMQA score \\>0.4. Thus, if the score is greater than 0.4,\nthen the model is likely good and models with score \\<0.3 are likely bad ones.\nModels with score 0.3-0.4 are uncertain and should not be classified with\nVoroMQA. On the other hand, ModFold is a meta-tool that provides you a very\ndetailed report (and parseable files) with local and global scores, but it can\ntake hours/days to obtain the result, so tend to use it only with selected\nmodels.\n\nAnother key parameter that you should know if you want to compare protein\nstructures is the **alpha carbon RMSD** (see [Structure alignment\nsection](ddbb.html#sec-alignment)). Any protein structural alignment will give\nyou this parameter as an estimation of the difference of the structures. You can\nalign structure with many online servers, like\n[FATCAT2](http://fatcat.godziklab.org/) or using molecular visualization apps,\nlike [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) or\n[PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) (see [Protein Structure\nDisplay](pdb.html#sec-apps) section).\n\n#### [Which model is better?

The use of models entails a precaution\nand a need for experimental validation. However, knowing the limitations of our\nmodel is required for a realist use of it; and limits are defined by the model\nquality.\n\nThe accuracy of a comparative model is related to the percentage sequence\nidentity on which it is based. High-accuracy comparative models can have about\n1-2 Å root mean square (RMS) error for the main-chain atoms, which is comparable\nto the accuracy of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure or an x-ray\nstructure. These models can be used for functional studies and the prediction of\nprotein partners, including drugs or other proteins working in the same process.\nAlso, for some detailed studies, it would be convenient to refine your model by\n[*Molecular Dynamics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) and\nrelated methods towards a native-like structure. I suggest checking the review\nby @adiyaman2019 on this topic.\n\nOn the contrary, low-accuracy comparative models are based on less than 20-30%\nsequence identity, hindering the modeling capacity and accuracy.
