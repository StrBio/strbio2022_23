The great promise of SB is predicated on the\nbelief that a high-resolution structural information about biological systems\nwill allow us to precisely reason about the function of these systems and the\neffects of modifications and perturbations.\n\nThe goals of SB require at least four different research lines (see Chapter 1 in\n@structura):\n\n1.  *Visualization* of complex structures with several sources of information:\n    sequence, structural data, electrostatic fields, location of functional\n    sites, and areas of variability.\n\n2.  *Classification* of the structures, making if necessary to cluster similar\n    structures together in a hierarchical classification allow us to identify\n    common origins and diversification paths. Similar to other fields of biology\n    classification is tedious but required to understand the structural space.\n\n3.  *Prediction* of structures remains an area of keen interest and a field of\n    research itself. As we will see below, the number of different sequences is\n    much higher than the availability of structures, which make prediction an\n    essential and useful tool.\n\n4.  *Simulation.* Experimentally obtained structures are primarily static\n    structural models (see warning below). However, the properties of these\n    molecules are often the results of their dynamic motions. The definition of\n    energy functions that govern the folding of proteins and their subsequent\n    stable dynamics can be analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations, although\n    computation capacities may be limiting to reach a biologically relevant\n    timescales.\n\nPowered by large amount of data and great technical advances, the field has\nexperienced a great revolution in the last decade. The increase of experimental\ncapacities to analyze the structure of proteins and other biological molecules\nand structures (see @callaway2020) and the development of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-assisted structure prediction boosted the capacity of\nlife-science researchers to address a wide variety of questions regarding\nproteins diversity, evolution and function. This revolution underwent a great\nacceleration in the last 2-3 years and the implications in biology,\nbiotechnology, and biomedicine are still unforeseen.\n\n# Before going forward: Protein Structure 101 {#sec-str}\n\nAlthough you can make some protein modeling without being an expert in\nstructural biology, a basic understanding of protein structure is strongly\nadvisable. In this course there are some students without a background in\nbiology. Moreover, over the years, I noticed that graduate students in biology,\nbiomedicine, and related fields have a very different background on protein\nstructure. If you want to review and update your background on protein\nstructure, I recommend you reading Chapter 2 of @structur, the great recent\nreview by @stollar2020 and the\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure) and\n[Proteopedia](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Introduction_to_protein_structure)\narticles on protein structures, which constituted my main source for this brief\nsection (follow picture links).\n\n[![Protein structure levels, using human PCNA (PDB 1AXC) as an\nexample.](pics/Protein_structure.png \"Protein Structure\"){#fig-str\n.figure}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure)\n\nProteins are key components of life, playing key roles in almost any possible\nvital function, either as structural, or scaffolding elements or as active\nenzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions. Proteins are built as polymers of\namino acids and the sequence of amino acids of a particular protein can be also\ncalled the **primary structure** of the protein. Amino acid chains can\nspontaneously fold up into three-dimensional structures, mostly stabilized by\nhydrogen bonds between amino acids. The amino acid sequence determines different\nlayers of 3D structure. Each of the 20 natural amino acids has different\nphysicochemical properties that affect its preferred conformation. Thus, the\nfirst level of folding is called **secondary structure**, forming common\npatterns as we will see in a moment.\n\n[![Amino acids clasification by\ntype](pics/aa.png \"Amino acids clasification by type\"){#fig-aa\n.figure}](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/acyald/venn_diagram_showing_the_properties_of_the_20/)\n\nThese stretches of secondary structure patterns can fold in 3D due to\ninteractions between the side chains of amino acids. This is called protein\n**tertiary structure**. Finally, two or more individual peptide chains can form\nmultisubunit proteins that have the so-called **quaternary structure**.\n\nIt should be noted that the peptide bond itself cannot rotate as it has a double\nbond-like character. Therefore, rotation can only occur about the bond between\nthe Cα and the C = O group, (the phi (φ) angle) and the Cα and the NH group,\n(the psi (ψ) angle). In fact, the polypeptide backbone chain is composed of a\nrepeating series of two rotatable bonds followed by one non-rotatable (peptide)\nbond. However, not all 360º of the psi and phi angles are possible as\nneighboring sidechains can clash due to steric hindrance. For certain angles and\namino acid combinations, the atoms cannot be in the same physical place and this\npartly explains why some amino acids have a higher propensity (likelihood) to\nform different types of secondary structures.\n\n[![Scheme of a generic polypeptide chain. Residue side chains are denoted as R.\nColoured rectangles indicate sets of six atoms that are coplanar due to the\ndouble-bond character of the peptide bond. Arrows indicate the bonds that are\nfree to rotate with the angle of rotation about the N--Cα known as phi and about\nthe Cα--C known as psi. Note that only peptide backbone bonds are labeled and in\nmost cases the R group bond is free to\nrotate.](pics/peptide_bond.png \"Peptide bond\"){#fig-bond\n.figure}](https://portlandpress.com/essaysbiochem/article/64/4/649/226515/Uncovering-protein-structure)\n\nWithin these restraints, the two principal local conformations that avoid steric\nhindrance and maximize backbone--backbone hydrogen bonding are the **α-helix**\nand the **β-sheet** secondary structures. The α-helix was proposed initially as\nleft-handed by Linus Pauling in 1951, but the crystal structure of myoglobin in\n1958 showed that, although both can be found, the right-handed form is the\ncommon one. In the common right-handed helices, the backbone NH group hydrogen\nbonds to the backbone C = O group of the amino acid located four residues\nearlier along the protein sequence. This results in a polypeptide chain that\ntwists in a regular coil shape with the R-groups pointing outwards away from the\npeptide backbone. It takes approximately 3.6 residues to complete a full turn of\na helix.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n[![Alpha helix](pics/alpha.gif \"Alpha helix\"){#fig-alpha\n.figure}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_helix)\n\n[![Beta sheet](pics/Animated_Beta_sheet.gif \"Beta sheet\"){#fig-beta\n.figure}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet)\n:::\n\nDifferent amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming α-helical\nstructures. [Methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine \"Methionine\"),\n[alanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine \"Alanine\"),\n[leucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine \"Leucine\"),\n[glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate \"Glutamate\"), and\n[lysine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine \"Lysine\") have especially high\nhelix-forming propensities, whereas\n[proline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline \"Proline\") and\n[glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine \"Glycine\") have poor\nhelix-forming propensities.\n[Proline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline \"Proline\") either breaks or\nkinks a helix, both because it cannot donate an amide [hydrogen\nbond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond \"Hydrogen bond\") (having no\namide hydrogen), and also because its bulky sidechain interferes sterically with\nthe backbone of the preceding turn. However, proline is often seen as the\n*first* residue of a helix, it is presumed due to its structural rigidity. At\nthe other extreme, [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine \"Glycine\")\nalso tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes\nit entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained α-helical\nstructure.\n\n**β-Sheets** are composed of two or more extended polypeptide chains called\nβ-strands that run alongside each other. They can be arranged in either a\nparallel or antiparallel manner. The residues arrange themselves in a regular\nzigzag manner with the adjacent peptide bonds pointing in opposite directions.\nIn this arrangement, the NH group and the C = O group of each amino acid are\nhydrogen-bonded to the C = O group and NH group respectively on the adjacent\nstrands. Chains can run in opposite directions, forming an antiparallel β-sheet,\nor in the same direction, forming a parallel β-sheet. Sidechains from each of\nthe residues point away from the sheets and alternate in opposite directions\nbetween residues. It is common to see a pattern of alternating hydrophilic and\nhydrophobic residues in the primary structure, giving the β-sheets hydrophilic\nand hydrophobic faces.\n\nLarge aromatic residues\n([tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine \"Tyrosine\"),\n[phenylalanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine \"Phenylalanine\"),\n[tryptophan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan \"Tryptophan\")) and\nβ-branched amino acids\n([threonine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threonine \"Threonine\"),\n[valine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valine \"Valine\"),\n[isoleucine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine \"Isoleucine\")) are favored\nto be found in β-strands. As in the case of α-helixes, β-strands are often ended\nby [glycines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine \"Glycine\"), which are\nespecially common in β-turns (the most common connector between strands), as\n[amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid \"Amino acid\") with\npositive φ angles.\n\nThe side chain of amino acids also have their torsion angles, referred as χ1,\nχ2, χ3...\n\n[![Dihedral angles in glutamate: Dihedral angles are the main degrees of freedom\nfor the backbone (ϕ and ψ angles) and the side chain (χ angles) of an amino\nacid. The number of χ angles varies between zero and four for the 20 standard\namino acids.

This was initially shown by [Gopalasamudram\nRamachandran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._N._Ramachandran), who also\ndevised a plot to visualize the allowed angle values, so-called Ramachandran\nplot. This plot can represent the angles of a particular amino acid, of all the\namino acids in a protein or many proteins. Analysis of φ and ψ angles in known\nproteins clearly show that roughly three-quarters of all possible φ, ψ\ncombinations are excluded.\n\n[![General Ramachandran plot. The density of points reflects how likely is each\nangle combination, defining the core (red line) and tolerance (orange)\nregions.](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/images/9/90/Ramachandran_plot_general_100K.jpg \"General Ramachandran plot\"){#fig-rama0\n.figure}](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Ramachandran_Plot)\n\nThe core regions in the Rama plot also correspond with common secondary\nstructures, as usually represented in textbooks.\n\n![Definition of secondary structure alternatives by their combination of phi,\npsi angles.](pics/rama2.png \"Textbook Rama plot\"){#fig-ram .figure}\n\nFunctionally and structurally relevant residues are more likely than others to\nhave torsion angles that plot to the [allowed but disfavored]{.ul} regions of a\nRamachandran plot. The specific geometry of these functionally relevant\nresidues, while somewhat energetically unfavorable, may be important for the\nprotein's function, catalytic or otherwise. Such conformations need to be\nstabilized by the protein using H-bonds, steric packing, or other means, and\nshould very seldom occur for highly solvent-exposed residues.\n\n[![Ramachandran plots for glycine (lef) and proline (right) Inner contour\nencloses 98% and 99.9% of Top structures data, indicating the favored and\nallowed regions, respectively\n.](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/images/8/85/Ramachandran_Gly_Pro_data_and_contours_T8000_small.jpg){#fig-rama2\n.figure}](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Ramachandran_Plot)\n\n## Protein folds, domains and motifs\n\nThe final three dimensional tertiary structure of a protein is commonly referred\nas its **fold**. Within the overall protein fold, we can recognize distinct\n**domains** and **motifs.** Domains are compact sections of the protein that\nrepresent structurally and (usually) functionally independent regions. That\nmeans that a domain maintain its main features, even if separated from the\noverall protein. On the other hand, motifs are small substructures that are not\nnecessarily independent and consist of only a few secondary structure stretches.\nIndeed, motifs can be also referred as *super-secondary* structure.\n\nThe diversity of protein folds, domains and motifs, and combination of those,\ncan be used for classification of protein structures hierarchically, as in many\nother fields of biology. The first classification was proposed in the 70's and\nconsisted of four groups of folds, as shown in the figure below. All-α proteins\nare based almost entirely on an α-helical structure, and all β-structure are\nbased on β-sheets. α/β structure is based on am mixture of α-helices and\nβ-sheet, often organized as parallel β-strands connected by α-helices. Finally\nα+β structures consist of discrete α-helix and β-sheet motifs that are not\ninterwoven (as they are in α/β proteins).\n\n![The four structural protein classes in the classification by Chlothia &\nLevitt. Modified from @structur using 1I2T, 1K76, 1H75 and 1EM7\nstructures.](pics/clasif.png){#fig-chlothia .figure}\n\nAs known fold space has become more and more complex, these types of\nclassifications have been adjusted and extended such that a complete hierarchy\nis created. The most commonly referred approaches to this sort of classification\nare those used by SCOP and CATH databases, as we will see in the [Structural\nDatabases](ddbb.html#strDDBB) section.\n\n## [**Hands on: Playing with secondary structures**]{style=\"color:green\"}\n\n![](pics/handson.png \"Hands-on\")\n\nThere are a few online alternatives to model any peptide sequence and quickly\nsee the effect of amino acid composition in the secondary structure. One of the\nbest-known is Foldit ([www.fold.it](http://www.fold.it), @miller2020), a gaming\nplatform for biochemistry and structural biology teaching. It is a highly\nrecommended alternative for most courses related to protein structure.\n\nIn this course we are going to try a more recent proposal, recently twitted by\nSergey Ovchinnikov (see\n<https://twitter.com/sokrypton/status/1535857255647690753>). It is based on\nColabFold (see <https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold> and @mirdita2022), an\nAlphafold2 (see @jumper2021) free notebook in [Google Colab\nnotebook](https://colab.research.google.com/?hl=en).
