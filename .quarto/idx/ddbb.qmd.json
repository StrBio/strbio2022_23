The\nidentification and statistical measure of the similarities between two or more\nstructures allow their classification and infer functional and evolutionary\nrelationships. Moreover, this process is essential during protein modeling,\nallowing to identify, assess, and select intermediate models.\n\nIt is also important to clear up any possible confusion between alignment and\nsuperposition, as they are often interchanged in the literature. An structural\nalignment tries to identify similarities and differences between two structures,\nwhile structure superposition requires the previous knowledge of such\nequivalences. Thus, superposition tires to minimize the distance between already\nknown equivalent structures by finding a transformation that produces either the\nlowest root-mean-square deviation\n([**RMSD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions))\nor the maximal equivalences within an RMSD cutoff. The RMSD can be calculated\nfor any pair of molecules. Regarding proteins, we usually refer to the *RMSD of\nthe alpha-carbons*. A better alignment will allow a better superposition. Thus,\nalthough alignment and superposition are two different processes, the RMSD can\nbe used as an indication of both (the lowest RMSD, the best\nalignment/superposition).\n\n![Structural alignment of three different AP endoncleases with the\n[*cealign*]{.ul} algorithm implemented in Pymol. The RMSD and the number of\naligned residues for each pair of structures is\nindicated.](pics/rmsd.png \"RMSD_example\"){#fig-rmsd .figure width=\"500\"}\n\n# Major protein databases\n\nClassification of protein sequences allow to understand the diversity of\ndifferent proteins by their sequence, i.e., the protein sequence space. However,\nclassification of protein structures aim to group proteins based on their\nstructural relationships. Some of these classification schemes explore the\nconcept of structural neighbourhood (structural continuum), whereas other\nutilize the notion of protein evolution as a driving force of diversification\nand thus provide a discrete rather than continuum protein structure space\n[@andreeva2012].\n\nThis section does not aim to comprehensively review all protein databases in\ndetail. Indeed, you probably already know most of the databases we are\ndiscussing. We will clarify the main differences and applications of Pfam,\nUniprot, Prosite, PDB, SCOP & CATH. As usual, I encourage you to check out\nonline in the references mentioned below for more detailed information.\n\n![Major protein databases. Although most of these databases are around 30 years\nold (or more), since they were created (or renovated) during the last years of\nthe 20th century or the early\n21st.](pics/ddbb.png \"Protein databases\"){#fig-ddbb .figure width=\"383\"}\n\nIn bioinformatics, databases are often categorized as primary or secondary.\n**Primary databases** are populated with experimentally derived data such as\nnucleotide sequence, protein sequence or macromolecular structure. Importantly,\nonce given a database accession number, the data in primary databases are never\nchanged: they form part of the scientific record. By contrast, **secondary\ndatabases** comprise data derived from the results of analysing primary data.\nSecondary databases often draw upon information from numerous sources, including\nother databases and the scientific literature. They are highly curated, often\nusing a complex combination of computational algorithms and/or manual analysis\nand interpretation to derive new knowledge from the public record of science.\n\nThe main protein primary databases are NCBI Protein for protein sequenes and\nRCSB-PDB for protein structures. Uniprot (see below) also contains a primary\nsequence database, named TrEMBL. It also incorporated in 2002 PIR-PSD, joining\nthe databases of the Protein information Resource, EMBL and SIB in a single\n(meta)database (see\n<https://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/dbinfo/pir_psd.shtml>). On the\nother hand, RCSB-PDB is the major structural primary database, whereas SCOP2 and\nCATH are secondary databases.\n\n## Sequence databases\n\n### Uniprot\n\nThe [Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/) databases are maintained by the Uniprot\nconsortium, created in 2002 by\n[EMBL-EBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bioinformatics_Institute),\n[SIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Institute_of_Bioinformatics), and\n[PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Information_Resource). Uniprot can\nbe considered nowadays as a metadatabase as its entries contain information from\ndiverse sources. It was created with two goals, constitute a non-redundant\ncomprehensive protein sequence database and enrich that database with annotation\nof those proteins. Annotations include, but it is not limited to: protein and\ngene families, function and structure-function available data, interactions with\nother proteins or cofactor, localization, patterns of expression, variants...\nThus, it aims to join the goals of both primary and secondary DDBBs.\n\nThe central hub of Uniprot databases is [Uniprot\nKnowledgebase](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb). It is a collection of\nfunctional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent, and rich\nannotation. The UniProtKB consists of two internal databases: a section\ncontaining manually-annotated records with information extracted from\nliterature, community suggestions, and curator-evaluated computational analysis,\nand a section with computationally analyzed records. For the sake of continuity\nand name recognition, the two sections are referred to as \"UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot\"\n(reviewed, manually annotated) and \"UniProtKB/TrEMBL\" (unreviewed, automatically\nannotated), respectively.\n\nBesides cross-references to structural information, in the last years, UniprotKB\nhas also incorporated structural data from\n[Alphafold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) database (created by DeepMind and\nEBI), [see \"State-of-the-art protein modeling with Deep Learning-based methods\"\nmodule](ai.html).\n\nSequences with different detail of annotation can be found in two overlapping\nand complementary databases in Uniprot:\n[Uniparc](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc) and\n[Uniref](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref). Briefly, UniParc (UniProt\nArchive) is a comprehensive and non-redundant database that contains most of the\npublicly available protein sequences in the world. UniParc avoided redundancy by\nstoring each unique sequence only once and giving it a stable and unique\nidentifier (**UPI**) making it possible to identify the same protein from\ndifferent source databases. A UPI is never removed, changed, or reassigned. On\nthe other hand, UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of\nsequences from the UniprotKB (and selected UniParc records) in order to obtain\ncomplete coverage of the sequence space at several resolutions while hiding\nredundant sequences (but not their descriptions) from view. The UniRef100\ndatabase combines identical sequences into a single UniRef entry, displaying the\nsequence of a representative protein, the accession numbers of all the merged\nentries, and links to the corresponding. UniRef90 is built by clustering\nUniRef100 sequences using the MMseqs2 algorithm [@steinegger2018] such that each\ncluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% sequence identity and\n80% overlap with the longest sequence (a.k.a. [**seed\nsequence**](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref_seed) ) of the cluster.\nSimilarly, UniRef50 is built by clustering UniRef90 seed sequences that have at\nleast 50% sequence identity to and 80% overlap with the longest sequence in the\ncluster. UniParc and Uniref contain only protein sequences. All other\ninformation about the protein must be retrieved from the source databases using\nthe database cross-references.\n\n### InterPro\n\n[InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) aims to be a functional secondary\ndatabase, by classifying proteins into families, domains, and important sites.\nTo classify proteins in this way, InterPro uses predictive models, known as\nsignatures, provided by several different databases (up to 13) that make up the\nInterPro consortium. InterPro combines those different signatures representing\nequivalent families, domains, or sites, and provides additional information such\nas descriptions, literature references, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce\na comprehensive resource for protein classification (see @blum2021).\n\nInterPro database is updated every 2 months and it is very useful for\n**annotation** of ORFans or divergent proteins.\n\n### Pfam\n\nPfam is a protein database that aims to classify sequences by their evolutionary\nrelationships. It was founded in 1995 and it has been very useful for functional\nannotation of genomic data. Pfam's website (<http://pfam.xfam.org/>) will be\nclosed by the end of 2022. However, Pfam database will not be discontinued but\nintegrated into the InterPro web site (see the [Xfam Blog\nentry](https://xfam.wordpress.com/2022/08/04/pfam-website-decommission/)).\n\nPfam uses\n[HMM](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/protein-classification-intro-ebi-resources/what-are-protein-signatures/signature-types/what-are-hmms/)\nprofiles (we will discuss HMMs in the [Homology Modeling](homology.qmd) module)\nto classify proteins into families, which are grouped into clans. Check out the\nEBI course about using Pfam:\n<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/pfam-creating-protein-families/>\n\nThe current release (35.0) contains 19,632 entries (families and clans). Pfam\nwas designed as a database that should be often updated in the fast-forward\ngenomic era. To this aim, they use two alignment types. Each Pfam family has a\nseed alignment that contains a representative set of sequences for the entry. A\nprofile hidden Markov model (HMM) is automatically built from the seed alignment\nand searched against a sequence database called *pfamseq* using the HMMER3\nsoftware (<http://hmmer.org/>). All sequence regions that satisfy a\nfamily-specific curated threshold, also known as the gathering threshold, are\naligned to the profile HMM to create the full alignment [@mistry2020].\n\nIn addition to the HMM-based Pfam entries (**Pfam-A**), the Pfam profiles are\nused to provide a set of unannotated, computationally generated multiple\nsequence alignments called **Pfam-B**. However, in the last Pfam versions, the\nPfam-B alignments are presently only released on the Pfam FTP site.\n\nPfam has also been used in the creation of other resources such as\n[Rfam](https://rfam.org/) (RNA families) and [Dfam](https://www.dfam.org/)\n(transposable DNA elements).\n\n## Structure databases {#strDDBB}\n\n### RCSB-PDB\n\nThe Protein Data Bank (PDB, [www.rcsb.org](www.rcsb.org)) database is the major\nmacromolecule structural primary database [@burley2021]. It contains mostly\nprotein structures, but also spans nucleic acids and nucleoprotein complexes.\nPDB turned 50 in 2021 and you can see a detailed overview of its [history in the\nRCSB-PDB site.](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/about-us/history)\n\nBriefly, the PDB was established in 1971 at Brookhaven National Laboratory with\nonly 7 structures. Then, the **Research Collaboratory for Structural\nBioinformatics** (RCSB), formed by Rutgers, UCSD/SDSC, and CARB/NIST, became\nresponsible for the management of the PDB in 1998 in response to an RFP and a\nlengthy review process. In 2003, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank\n([wwPDB](http://wwpdb.org/)) was formed to maintain a single PDB archive of\nmacromolecular structural data that is freely and publicly available to the\nglobal community. It consists of organizations that act as deposition, data\nprocessing and distribution centers for PDB data.\n\nPDB structures are largely obtained by X-ray crystallography, but it accepts\nderived from EM and RMN data since 1989 and 1991, respectively. Indeed, the BMRB\n([Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank](https://bmrb.io/)) has partnered with the\nPDB since 2006 and the EMBD ([Electron Microscopy Data\nBank](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/)) since 2021. Furthermore, [starting September\n2022](https://www.rcsb.org/news/6304ee57707ecd4f63b3d3db), the PDB also contains\ncomputed models from the [Alphafold database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)\n(which we will discuss later in this course) and\n[RoseTTAFold-ModelArchive](https://www.modelarchive.org/). **Thus, the PDB\ndatabase is the major hub that centralizes biological structures nowadays.**\n\nPDB database has four mirrors and websites ([RCSB](www.rcsb.org),\n[Europe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/), [BMRB](https://bmrb.io/), and\n[Japan](https://pdbj.org/)) with mainly overlapping information, although they\nhave some specialization. The RCSB PDB site has also an educational section\n([PDB-101](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/)) with very useful info and resources for\nteaching and learning structural biology and the work with PDB structures.\n\nThe PDB entries contain all the information about the structure, spanning from\nthe protein sequence and source to the experiment details, as well as the\nstructure assessment (see [Structural quality assurance](pdb.html#sec-assess)\nsection) and visualization. You can download all this information and the\nstructure coordinates in diverse file formats.\n\n### SCOP\n\nThe Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP,\n[http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk](http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)) database is a\n*classification of protein domains* organized according to their evolutionary\nand structural relationships in hierarchical categories. The main unit is the\n*family* that groups related proteins with clear evidence for their evolutionary\norigin while the *superfamily* brings together more distantly related protein\ndomains. Further, superfamilies are grouped into distinct *folds* on the basis\nof the global structural features shared by the majority of their members.\nDomain definitions are provided for the two main levels of the SCOP\nclassification, family and superfamily, and the domain boundaries for each of\nthese can coincide or differ [@andreeva2020].\n\nFor each group, a representative is selected based on its sequence (UniProtKB)\nand structure (PDB) and used for SCOP classification. Thus, the SCOP domain\nboundaries are assigned to both, the PDB and UniProtKB entry.\n\n### CATH\n\nCATH ([www.cathdb.info](www.cathdb.info)) is a free, publicly available resource\nthat identifies protein domains within proteins from the Protein Data Bank and\nclassifies them into evolutionary-related groups according to sequence,\nstructure, and function information. It assumes that related proteins which fold\nalike often exhibit similar functions (this only could be demonstrated if we\nfind intermediates). CATH uses a hierarchical classification scheme where the\nunits compared and classified are structural domains. Domains, defined here as\nglobular structural domains capable of semi-independent folding, are extracted\nfrom experimentally determined protein structures available in the PDB database.\nThe domains are classified into the following hierarchical levels that compose\nthe CATH name: Class (**C**), Architecture (**A**), Topology (**T**), and\nHomologous superfamilies (**H**).\n\nCATH uses a combination of several structure-based (SSAP, CATHEDRAL) and\nsequence-based (Needleman-Wunsch-based sequence alignments, Jackhmmer, Profile\nComparer, and HHsearch) algorithms to assess the similarity of domains to each\nother and to identify protein homologues [@sillitoe2021].\n\nCATH has a sister resource, Gene3D, that adds in additional protein domain\nsequences with no known structure, which brings the current total number of\ndomains in CATH-Gene3D up to 95 million.\n\nCATH database is updated quite regularly through daily snapshots (CATH-B), but a\nfull release with more tools, named CATH+ is released every 12 months. CATH-plus\ncontains functional families (CATH-FunFams), structural clusters, and other\ntools [@sillitoe2021].\n\n## Graphical summary\n\n[![Main features of protein databases (updated in\n2020)](pics/bbdd_full.png){#fig-full\n.figure}](https://github.com/StrBio/strbio2022_23/raw/main/pics/bbdd_full.pdf)\n\n# [**DDBBs Practice**]{style=\"color:green\"}\n\nRemember to work on groups as assigned.

Furthermore, [starting September\n2022](https://www.rcsb.org/news/6304ee57707ecd4f63b3d3db), the PDB also contains\ncomputed models from the [Alphafold database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)\n(which we will discuss later in this course) and\n[RoseTTAFold-ModelArchive](https://www.modelarchive.org/). **Thus, the PDB\ndatabase is the major hub that centralizes biological structures nowadays.**\n\nPDB database has four mirrors and websites ([RCSB](www.rcsb.org),\n[Europe](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/), [BMRB](https://bmrb.io/), and\n[Japan](https://pdbj.org/)) with mainly overlapping information, although they\nhave some specialization. The RCSB PDB site has also an educational section\n([PDB-101](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/)) with very useful info and resources for\nteaching and learning structural biology and the work with PDB structures.\n\nThe PDB entries contain all the information about the structure, spanning from\nthe protein sequence and source to the experiment details, as well as the\nstructure assessment (see [Structural quality assurance](pdb.html#sec-assess)\nsection) and visualization. You can download all this information and the\nstructure coordinates in diverse file formats.\n\n### SCOP\n\nThe Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP,\n[http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk](http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)) database is a\n*classification of protein domains* organized according to their evolutionary\nand structural relationships in hierarchical categories. The main unit is the\n*family* that groups related proteins with clear evidence for their evolutionary\norigin while the *superfamily* brings together more distantly related protein\ndomains. Further, superfamilies are grouped into distinct *folds* on the basis\nof the global structural features shared by the majority of their members.\nDomain definitions are provided for the two main levels of the SCOP\nclassification, family and superfamily, and the domain boundaries for each of\nthese can coincide or differ [@andreeva2020].\n\nFor each group, a representative is selected based on its sequence (UniProtKB)\nand structure (PDB) and used for SCOP classification. Thus, the SCOP domain\nboundaries are assigned to both, the PDB and UniProtKB entry.\n\n### CATH\n\nCATH ([www.cathdb.info](www.cathdb.info)) is a free, publicly available resource\nthat identifies protein domains within proteins from the Protein Data Bank and\nclassifies them into evolutionary-related groups according to sequence,\nstructure, and function information. It assumes that related proteins which fold\nalike often exhibit similar functions (this only could be demonstrated if we\nfind intermediates). CATH uses a hierarchical classification scheme where the\nunits compared and classified are structural domains. Domains, defined here as\nglobular structural domains capable of semi-independent folding, are extracted\nfrom experimentally determined protein structures available in the PDB database.\nThe domains are classified into the following hierarchical levels that compose\nthe CATH name: Class (**C**), Architecture (**A**), Topology (**T**), and\nHomologous superfamilies (**H**).\n\nCATH uses a combination of several structure-based (SSAP, CATHEDRAL) and\nsequence-based (Needleman-Wunsch-based sequence alignments, Jackhmmer, Profile\nComparer, and HHsearch) algorithms to assess the similarity of domains to each\nother and to identify protein homologues [@sillitoe2021].\n\nCATH has a sister resource, Gene3D, that adds in additional protein domain\nsequences with no known structure, which brings the current total number of\ndomains in CATH-Gene3D up to 95 million.\n\nCATH database is updated quite regularly through daily snapshots (CATH-B), but a\nfull release with more tools, named CATH+ is released every 12 months. CATH-plus\ncontains functional families (CATH-FunFams), structural clusters, and other\ntools [@sillitoe2021].\n\n## Graphical summary\n\n[![Main features of protein databases (updated in\n2020)](pics/bbdd_full.png){#fig-full\n.figure}](https://github.com/StrBio/strbio2022_23/raw/main/pics/bbdd_full.pdf)\n\n# [**DDBBs Practice**]{style=\"color:green\"}\n\nRemember to work on groups as assigned. Groups should be the same for all the\ncourse exercises.\n\n## Classify the following protein structures into \"groups\" and \"subgroups\"\n\nFocus only in structural databases (CATH, Scop2), but any given database can be\nhelpful in a different way. Use generic terms, valid for any hierarchical\nclassification, independent of the database(s) used.\n\n| Structures |\n|------------|\n| 2MNA       |\n| 2WB0       |\n| 1C0A       |\n| 1QUM       |\n| 5ZHZ       |\n| 5CFE       |\n| 1DE9       |\n| 6WCD       |\n| 1AKO       |\n| 6KHY       |\n\n## Answer these questions\n\n#### **a.
