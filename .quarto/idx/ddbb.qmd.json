The\nidentification and statistical measure of the similarities between two or more\nstructures allow their classification and infer functional and evolutionary\nrelationships. Moreover, this process is essential during protein modeling,\nallowing to identify and select intermediate models.\n\nIt is also important to clear up any possible confusion between alignment and\nsuperposition, as they are often interchanged in the literature. An structural\nalignment tries to identify similarities and differences between two structures,\nwhile structure superposition requires the previous knowledge of such\nequivalences. Thus, superposition tires to minimize the distance between already\nknown equivalent structures by finding a transformation that produces either the\nlowest root-mean-square deviation (**RMSD**) or the maximal equivalences within\nan RMSD cutoff. A better alignment will allow a better superposition. Thus,\nalthough alignment and superposition are two different processes, the RMSD can\nbe used as an indication of both (the lowest RMSD, the best\nalignment/superposition).\n\n# Major protein databases\n\nThis section does not aim to comprehensively review all protein databases in\ndetail. Indeed, you probably already know most of the databases we are\ndiscussing. We will clarify the main differences and applications of Pfam,\nUniprot, Prosite, PDB, SCOP & CATH. As usual, I encourage you to check out\nonline in the references mentioned below for more detailed information.\n\n![Major protein databases. Although most of these databases are around 30 years\nold (or more), since they were created (or renovated) during the last years of\nthe 20th century or the early 21st.](pics/ddbb.png \"Protein databases\")\n\nIn bioinformatics, databases are often categorised as primary or\nsecondary. **Primary databases** are populated with experimentally derived data\nsuch as nucleotide sequence, protein sequence or macromolecular structure.\nImportantly, once given a database accession number, the data in primary\ndatabases are never changed: they form part of the scientific record. By\ncontrast, **secondary databases** comprise data derived from the results of\nanalysing primary data. Secondary databases often draw upon information from\nnumerous sources, including other databases and the scientific literature. They\nare highly curated, often using a complex combination of computational\nalgorithms and/or manual analysis and interpretation to derive new knowledge\nfrom the public record of science.\n\nThe main protein primary databases are NCBI Protein for protein sequenes and\nRCSB-PDB for protein structures. Uniprot (see below) also contains a primary\nsequence database, named TrEMBL. It also incorporated in 2002 PIR-PSD, joining\nthe databases of the Protein information Resource, EMBL and SIB in a single\n(meta)database (see\n<https://proteininformationresource.org/pirwww/dbinfo/pir_psd.shtml>).\n\n![Main features of protein databases](pics/bbdd_full.svg)\n\n## Sequence databases\n\n### Uniprot\n\n### InterPro\n\n### Pfam\n\n## Structure databases\n\n### RCSB-PDB\n\nd\n\n### SCOP\n\nsd\n\n### CATH\n\ndfa\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# References\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"ddbb.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.318","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","title":"Protein Databases","author":"Modesto Redrejo Rodríguez","date":"`r Sys.Date()`","toc_float":true,"editor_options":{"markdown":{"wrap":80}},"toc-location":"left"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
