Source:\nhttps://swissmodel.expasy.org/static/course/files/PartIII_quality_assesment.pdf](pics/magritte.png \"Ceci n'est pas une proteine\"){.figure}](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/static/course/files/PartIII_quality_assesment.pdf)\n\nThe surrealist Belgian painter René Magritte created a collection of\nsurrealistic paintings entitled [***La trahison des images***\n(1928--1929)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images \"Magritte\").\nThe most renowned of those paintings show a smoking pipe and the following\ncaption underneath: *\"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\"* (This is not a pipe). Yes,\nindeed! It is actually the painting of a pipe.\n\nSimilarly, a picture of a protein, or a PDB file with the coordinates of a\nprotein structure, is not a protein. It is a representation of ONE structure.\nEven experimentally determined structures have two main limitations that we\nshould always keep in mind: (1) they are a fixed structure whereas proteins *in\nvivo* are flexible and dynamic and (2) they are subjected to experimental error\nand they often contain regions of low reliability. Moreover, even experimentally\nobtained macromolecular structures are to some degree models, with a variable\nratio between experimental data and computational prediction to match the\nexperimental data (X-ray diffraction, cryo-EM density maps, NMR, SAXS, FRET...)\nwith previously known structures or prediction models. That does not mean that\nprotein structures are useless, they can be very useful, but we must be aware of\nthe limitations as well as the applications.\n\n# Protein structures & protein models\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# References",
