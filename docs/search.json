    "text": "Structural Bioinformatics (SB) is a broad discipline that covers structural and computational biology, from visualization and analysis of the structure of biomacromolecules to protein modeling and molecular docking. The great promise of SB is predicated on the belief that a high-resolution structural information about biological systems will allow us to precisely reason about the function of these systems and the effects of modifications and perturbations.\nThe goals of SB require at least four different research lines (see Chapter 1 in Gu and Bourne (2009)):\n\nVisualization of complex structures with several sources of information: sequence, structural data, electrostatic fields, location of functional sites, and areas of variability.\nClassification of the structures, making if necessary to cluster similar structures together in a hierarchical classification allow us to identify common origins and diversification paths. Similar to other fields of biology classification is tedious but required to understand the structural space.\nPrediction of structures remains an area of keen interest and a field of research itself. As we will see below, the number of different sequences is much higher than the availability of structures, which make prediction an essential and useful tool.\nSimulation. Experimentally obtained structures are primarily static structural models (see warning below). However, the properties of these molecules are often the results of their dynamic motions. The definition of energy functions that govern the folding of proteins and their subsequent stable dynamics can be analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations, although computation capacities may be limiting to reach a biologically relevant timescales.\n\nPowered by large amount of data and great technical advances, the field has experienced a great revolution in the last decade. The increase of experimental capacities to analyze the structure of proteins and other biological molecules and structures (see Callaway (2020)) and the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted structure prediction boosted the capacity of life-science researchers to address a wide variety of questions regarding proteins diversity, evolution and function. This revolution underwent a great acceleration in the last 2-3 years and the implications in biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine are still unforeseen."

Source: https://swissmodel.expasy.org/static/course/files/PartIII_quality_assesment.pdf\n\n\nThe surrealist Belgian painter René Magritte created a collection of surrealistic paintings entitled La trahison des images (1928–1929). The most renowned of those paintings show a smoking pipe and the following caption underneath: “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” (This is not a pipe). Yes, indeed! It is actually the painting of a pipe.\nSimilarly, a picture of a protein, or a PDB file with the coordinates of a protein structure, is not a protein. It is a representation of ONE structure. Even experimentally determined structures have two main limitations that we should always keep in mind: (1) they are a fixed structure whereas proteins in vivo are flexible and dynamic and (2) they are subjected to experimental error and they often contain regions of low reliability. Moreover, even experimentally obtained macromolecular structures are to some degree models, with a variable ratio between experimental data and computational prediction to match the experimental data (X-ray diffraction, cryo-EM density maps, NMR, SAXS, FRET…) with previously known structures or prediction models. That does not mean that protein structures are useless, they can be very useful, but we must be aware of the limitations as well as the applications."

    "text": "The number of protein sequences in databases growth exponentially during the last decades, particularly after the revolution of high throughput sequencing methods.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of entries in UniProt/TrEMBL (release 2022_2).\n\n\nHowever, experimental determination of 3D protein structures is often difficult, time-consuming, and subjected to limitations, such as experimental error, data interpretation and modeling new data on previously released structures. Thus, despite substantial efforts that started at the beginning of the 21st century to implement high-throughput structural biology methods (see for instance Manjasetty et al. 2008), the availability of protein structures is more than 1,000 times less than the number of sequences (>226M sequences for Uniprot and ∽195k structures in RCSB Protein Databank in August 2022). This difference is called the protein structure gap and it is constantly widening (Muhammed and Aki-Yalcin 2019).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Number of macromolecular structures in RCSB PDB database (accessed 6th July 2022).\n\n\nThus, an accurate prediction of the 3D structure of any given protein is needed to make up for the lack of experimental data.\n\n\nAmino acid properties determine the phi and psi angles that eventually shape the higher structural levels. Protein folding might be more complex though, as it should be coupled to protein synthesis.\nOne can think that complexity and diversity of protein structures in the nature may be huge. Indeed, upon their determination of the three-dimensional globular structure (myoglobin, 1958), John Kendrew and his coworkers seemed very disappointed (Kendrew et al. 1958):\nPerhaps the most remarkable features of the molecule are its complexity and its lack of symmetry. The arrangement seems to be almost totally lacking in the kind of regularities which one instinctively anticipates, and it is more complicated that has been anticipated by any theory of protein structure.\nNot much later, in 1968, Cyrus Levinthal (1922–1990) published the so-called Levinthal’s paradox, stating that proteins fold in nano/milliseconds, but even for small peptides it will take a huge time to test the astronomical number of possible conformations. Say a 100 aa small protein; it will have 99 peptidic bonds and 198 different phi and psi angles. Assuming only 3 alternative conformations for each bond, it will yield 3198 (= 2.95 x 1095) possible conformations. If we design a highly efficient algorithm that tests 1 conformation per nanosecond:\n 2.95 x 1085 secs = 9x1067 billions years\nConsidering that the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years, predicting protein structures does not seem an easy task.\nIn this context, a very simple experiment 50 years ago, led some light on the protein folding mechanism. Cristian Anfisen was able to completely denature (unfold) the Ribonuclease A, by the addition of reducing agents and urea under heat treatment, and subsequently switch to normal conditions that allow the protein to re-fold fully functional. This experiment indicates that the amino acid sequence dictates the final structure. Notwithstanding some relevant exceptions, this has been largely confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The Anfinsen Dogma: Amino acid sequence dictated the final structure. From Anfinsen (1973) .\n\n\nOne can imagine that in vivo native structures of proteins look-alike the lowest free energy conformation, i.e., the global energy minimum. That is the basis of the funnel model of protein folding, which assumes that the number of possible conformations is reduced when a local energy minimum is achieved, constituting a path for the folding process.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Schematic diagram of a protein folding energy landscape according to the funnel model. Denatured molecules at the top of the funnel might fold to the native state by a myriad of different routes, some of which involve transient intermediates (local energy minima) whereas others involve significant kinetic traps (misfolded states). From .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, prediction of protein structures is possible, as protein folding relies only on the protein sequence, but it will require virtually infinite time and computational resources.\n\n\nHomology modeling is one of the most convenient tricks to bypass that limitation. Basically, the strategy is adding all the possible extra information to the amino acid properties, namely the evolutionary conservation of sequences and structures.\nVery often, before generating models you already have some information about your protein. For instance, if it is an enzyme you may have spotted the catalytic residues or substrate-interaction region. It is also advisable to check the literature, particularly if there is a companion paper of the related PDB structure(s) that may be available or that you can eventually find and use as the template(s) for modeling."

    "text": "3.1 Step 1+2. Template search and align.\n\n3.1.0.1 Where can we search?\nTemplate searching consists in finding a protein with known structure that has a sequence similar to our protein. As we mentioned above, the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the largest database of protein structures, so we can search templates by comparing the sequence of our protein with the sequence of all the proteins in PDB. However, PDB was constructed to contain all the macromolecular structures, not for searching templates for modeling. Similar to other end-to-end software, SWISS-MODEL has its own curated database, called SMLT (SWISS-MODEL template library). This is based on PDB, updated weekly, and also annotated and indexed to boost searches. As of 6 July 2022, SMLT contains 133,049 unique protein sequences that map to 332,864 biological units (protein structures classified by their quaternary structure).\nNow, you first need your sequences. A protein sequence database like Uniprot or NCBI Protein, is a good place for this task.\nIf you want to cheat yourself, I give you the HAdV-2pol and NEIL2 sequences.\n\n\n3.1.0.2 How can we search accurately and fast?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery-template alignment is the base for homology modeling (Kelley (2009a))\n\n\nFinding templates require comparing sequences, thus an accurate and powerful alignment method is essential. Comparing one protein sequence with a whole database is time-consuming, as you will compare with totally unrelated proteins, which is a loss of resources. Two basic improvements increased the template search capacity, (1) the introduction of secondary structure (SS) by comparing SS predictions of the query protein and the secondary structures of the protein database, and (2) the use of profiles to make easier the comparison. Profiles are a mathematical way to summarize a multiple sequence alignment in which the frequency of each amino acid at each position is quantified. This allows the identification of highly conserved positions that not only define the protein function but also the fold. For instance, glycines at the end of each beta-strand or a pattern of polar residues that favor alpha-helices. A previous comparison of the query sequence with a database of sequences will allow us to include evolutionary information about it. Therefore, we moved from a requirement of >30% identity to obtain good models before the implementation of profiles, to good models even with ⁓20% identity or below. Moreover, the generation of profiles also facilitates clustering of the search database, reducing search time. The implementation of these capacities led to the implementation of the so-called fold recognition in homology modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom sequence vs. sequence search to profile-profile comparison (Kelley (2009b))\n\n\nTemplate searches in SWISS-MODEL are carried out with HHblits (Remmert et al. (2011)), a specific profile-profile method. We could search for templates also with Blast or other profile-profile methods, like Psi-BLAST, HHPred, or JackHMMER. Then templates are ranked by two different parameters, GMQE (global model quality estimate) and QSQE (quaternary structure quality estimate). Briefly, GMQE uses probability functions to assess several properties of the target-template alignment (sequence identity, sequence similarity, HHblits score, the agreement between predicted secondary structure of target and template, the agreement between predicted solvent accessibility between target and template; all normalized by alignment length) to predict the expected quality of the resulting model. QSQE assesses the oligomeric state probability of the model.\nNow, paste your sequences and click on Search.\nNote: If you click on “Build Model”, it will directly use the top-ranked template, so you’ll miss some fun, but you can go back for that later on if you change your mind.\n\n\n\nSWISS-MODEL modeling start\n\n\nBefore building the models, could you foresee which of our queries will give rise to a better model? Why?"

    "text": "3.2 Step 3. Model Building.\nBy default, SWISS-MODEL will provide 50 ranked possible templates. The output also contains information about the method and resolution of the templates, the % of identity (and alignment coverage) with the query sequence, and the GMQE and QSQE.\nThe top template is marked by default and it likely will give the best model, but it is also interesting to try some alternative templates depending on the downstream application of the model (see below). For instance with a different substrate/cofactor that can have a key role in the protein function or with different coverage or % identity.\nOnce the template(s) is selected, model coordinates are constructed based on the alignment of the query and template sequence using ProMod3 module (Studer et al. 2021). SWISS-MODEL uses a fragment assembly, which is also the bases of Fold-recognition or Threading methods (see Threading section). Other programs, like Modeller, are based in the satisfaction of general spatial restraints (Giacomo Janson et al. 2019). Modeller is a command-line tool that allow full customization of the modeling, which requires more knowledge about the process but can be very useful for some types of proteins. However, it has been implemented in some online servers (ModWeb) and user-friendly applications, including ChimeraX and Pymol (Pymod plugin, G. Janson and Paiardini (2021)). Modeller can be also called from the HHPred output (if you included PDB as a searchable database), which is very convenient to model remote homologs using several templates in a few minutes.\nFragment assembly will use the template core backbone atoms to build a core structure of the model, leaving non-conserved regions (mostly loops) for later. Loops modeling includes the use of a homologs subset of a dedicated loop database, Monte Carlo sampling as a fallback and even ab initio building or missing loops.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Backbone and loop modeling. From Expasy Protein Structure, Comparative Protein Modelling, and Visualisation.\n\n\nThen, positioning of side chain of non conserved amino acids is undertook. The goal is finding the most likely side chain conformation, using template structure information, rotamer libraries (from a curated set known protein structures) and energetic and packaging criteria. If many side chains have to be placed in the structure it will lead to a “chicken and egg problem”, as positioning one rotamer would affect others. That means that identification of possible hydrogen bonds between residues side chains and between side chains and the backbone reduce the optimization calculations. At the end of the day, the more residues correctly positioned, the best model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Side chain modeling. From CMBI Seminars on Bioinformatics.\n\n\nFinally, a short energy minimization is carried out to reduce the unfavorable contacts and bonds by adapting the angle geometries and relax close contacts. This energy minimization step or refinement can be useful to achieve better models but only when the folding is already accurate."

Output models are colored in a temperature color scale, from navy blue (good quality) to red (bad quality). That can help us to understand our model in a first sight. Also, this is an interactive site and you can zoom-in, zoom-out the model. Many other features are available to work on your model. For instance, you can compare multiple models, you can change the display options. You can also download all the files and reports on the “Project Data” button.\n\n\n\nFigure 15: NEIL2 model created with SWISS-MODEL (July 2022)\n\n\nThere is also a “Structure Assessment” option. This provide you a detailed report of the structural problems of your model. You can see Ramachandran plots that highlight in red the amino acid residues with abnormal phi/psi angles in the model and a detailed list of other problems.\nThe GMQE is updated to the QMEAN Zscore and QMEANDisCo (Studer et al. 2020). The QMEAN Z-score or the normalized QMEAN score indicates how the model is comparable to experimental structures of similar size. A QMEAN Z-score around 0 indicates good agreement, while score below -4.0 are given to models of low quality. Besides the number, a plot shows the QMEAN score of our model (red star) within all QMEAN scores of experimentally determined structures compared to their size. Overall, the Z-score is equivalent to the standard deviation of the mean.\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Per-residue QMEANDisCo scores are mapped as red-to-green colour gradient on a model of lbp-8 in Caenorhabditis elegans (UniProtKB: O02324, PDB: 6C1Z). Distance constraints have been constructed from an ensemble of experimentally determined protein structures that are homologous to lbp-8. The inset depicts two example constraints between residues marked with colour-coded spheres in the model. From Studer et al. (2020).\n\n\nThe QMEANDisCO was implemented in SWISS-MODEL in 2020 and it is a powerful, single parameter that combines statistical potentials and agreement terms with a distance constraints (DisCo) to provide a consensus score. DisCo evaluates consistencies of pairwise CA-CA distances from a model with constraints extracted from homologous structures. All scores are combined using a neural network trained to predict per-residue scores. We can check a global score, but also a local score for each residue, that help us to understand which regions of the model are more likely to accurately folded (i.e. they are more reliable).\n\n\n\nFigure 17: HAdV-2 DNA polymerase model obtained with SWISS-MODEL (July 2022).\n\n\nQMEANDisCo can be used to analyze models obtained with other methods in order to make them comparable (note that you can use QMEANDisCo for models obtained with any method, you just need a .pdb file). There are other independent model assessing tools commonly used to assess protein models, like VoroMQA [Olechnovič and Venclovas (2017)] or MoldFold (McGuffin et al. 2021). VoroMQA is very quick method that combines the idea of statistical potentials (i.e. a knowledge-based score function) with the use of interatomic contact areas to provide a score in the range of [0,1]. When applied to PDB database, most of the high-quality experimentally-based structures have a VoroMQA score >0.4. Thus, if the score is greater than 0.4, then the model is likely good and models with score <0.3 are likely bad ones. Models with score 0.3-0.4 are uncertain and should not be classified with VoroMQA. On the other hand, ModFold is a meta-tool that provides you a very detailed report (and parseable files) with local and global scores, but it can take hours/days to obtain the result, so tend to use it only with selected models.\nAnother key parameter that you should know if you want to compare protein structures is the alpha carbon RMSD (see Structure alignment section). Any protein structural alignment will give you this parameter as an estimation of the difference of the structures. You can align structure with many online servers, like RCSB, FATCAT2 or using molecular visualization apps, like ChimeraX or PyMOL (see Protein Structure Display section).\n\n3.3.0.1 Which model is better?

From .\n\n\nA big power entails a big responsibility. The use of models entails a precaution and a need for experimental validation. However, knowing the limitations of our model is required for a realist use of it; and limits are defined by the model quality.\nThe accuracy of a comparative model is related to the percentage sequence identity on which it is based. High-accuracy comparative models can have about 1-2 Å root mean square (RMS) error for the main-chain atoms, which is comparable to the accuracy of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure or an x-ray structure. These models can be used for functional studies and the prediction of protein partners, including drugs or other proteins working in the same process. Also, for some detailed studies, it would be convenient to refine your model by Molecular Dynamics and related methods towards a native-like structure. I suggest checking the review by Adiyaman and McGuffin (2019) on this topic.\nOn the contrary, low-accuracy comparative models are based on less than 20-30% sequence identity, hindering the modeling capacity and accuracy. Some of these models can be used for protein engineering purposes or to predict the function of orphan sequences based on the protein fold (using Dali or Foldseek).\nAs mentioned above, it also advisable to check the template structures and read the papers describing them in order to squeeze all the information from your model.\nWhat do you think you could use our models of NEIL2 and HAdV-2pol?"

    "text": "Why is Alphafold2 so accurate?\nThe phylosophy behind Alphafold and Alphafold2 is treating protein folding problem as a machine learning problem of processing of images. In all these problems, the input to the Deep Learning model is a volume (3D tensor). In case of computer vision, 2D images expand as a volume because of the RGB or HSV channels. Similarly, in the case of distance prediction, predicted 1D and 2D features are transformed and packed into 3D volume with many channels of inter-residue information (Pakhrin et al. 2021).\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of Deep Learning method development, the problem of protein distogram or real-valued distance prediction (bottom row) is similar to the ‘depth prediction problem’ in computer vision. From (Pakhrin et al. 2021)\n\n\nAlphafold2 can be explained in three independent tasks (see picture below). First, it queries several databases of protein sequences, and constructs an MSA that is used to select templates. In the second part of the diagram, AlphaFold 2 takes the multiple sequence alignment and the templates, and processess them in a transformer. The objective of this part is to extract layers of information to generate residue interaction maps.

    "text": "Corollary: Has Levinthal’s paradox “folded”?\nThe development of Alphafold and the Alphafold structures Database in collaboration with EMBL-EBI has been the origin of a New Era. Scientific publications and journals worldwide published long articles about the meaning of this breakthrough in science and its applications in biotechnology and biomedicine1 and DeepMind claimed to have Solved a 50-years Grand Challenge in biochemistry. The coverage of the protein structure space has been greatly increased (Porta-Pardo et al. 2022).\nHowever, some scientists have claimed that Alphafold2 and RoseTTAfold actually “cheat” a bit as it does not really solve the problem but generate a deep learning pipeline that “bypass” the problem (Pederson 2021). In agreement with that, it has been shown that machine learning methods actually do not reproduce the expected folding pathways while improving the structures during the recycling steps Outeiral, Nissley, and Deane (n.d.).\nIn conclusion, I do believe that Levinthal’s paradox has not been (yet) fully solved, but clearly almost (Al-Janabi 2022), and solving it will probably reduce the limitations of Alphafold2. However, CASP15 is currently being held and maybe I will have to change my mind later this year."

    "section": "Why is Alphafold2 so freaking accurate?",
    "text": "Why is Alphafold2 so freaking accurate?\nThe philosophy behind Alphafold and related methods is treating the protein folding problem as a machine learning problem, kind of of image processing. In all these problems, the input to the Deep Learning model is a volume (3D tensor). In the case of computer vision, 2D images expand as a volume because of the RGB or HSV channels. Similarly, in the case of distance prediction, predicted 1D and 2D features are transformed and packed into 3D volume with many channels of inter-residue information (Pakhrin et al. 2021).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: From the perspective of Deep Learning method development, the problem of protein distogram or real-valued distance prediction (bottom row) is similar to the ‘depth prediction problem’ in computer vision. From Pakhrin et al. (2021).\n\n\nAlphafold2 can be explained as a pipeline with three interconected tasks (see picture below). First, it queries several databases of protein sequences and constructs an MSA that is used to select templates. In the second part of the diagram, AlphaFold 2 takes the multiple sequence alignment and the templates, and processes them in a transformer. This process has been referred by some authors as inter-residue interaction map-threading (Bhattacharya et al. 2021). The objective of this part is to extract layers of information to generate residue interaction maps. A better model of the MSA will improve the network’s characterization of the geometry, which simultaneously will help refine the model of the MSA. Importantly, in the AF2 Evoformer, this process is iterative and the information goes back and forth throughout the network. At every recycling step, the complexity of the map increases and thus, the model improves (the original model uses 3 cycles). As explained in the great post from Carlos Outerial at the OPIG site:\n\nThis is easier to understand as an example. Suppose that you look at the multiple sequence alignment and notice a correlation between a pair of amino acids. Let’s call them A and B. You hypothesize that A and B are close, and translate this assumption into your model of the structure. Subsequently, you examine said model and observe that, since A and B are close, there is a good chance that C and D should be close. This leads to another hypothesis, based on the structure, which can be confirmed by searching for correlations between C and D in the MSA. By repeating this several times, you can build a pretty good understanding of the structure.\n\nThe third part of the pipeline is the structure building module, which uses the information from the previous steps to construct a 3D model structure protein of the query sequence. This network will give you a single model, without any energy optimization step. Model building is based in a new concept of 3D structures generation, named IPA (Invariant Point Attention) and the use of a curated list of parametrised list of torsion angles to generate the side chains.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Oxford Proteins Informatics Group Blog, modified From\n\n\nLike for most of the previous methods Alphafold would give your better results with proteins with related structures known and with a lot of homologs in Uniref databases. However, comparing to nothing, it will likely give you (limited) useful results for the so-called “dark genome”. I work with phages and bacterial mobile elements, and sequencing that is often frustrating as more than 50% of the proteins have no homologs in the database. So you have a bunch of proteins of unknown function… However, as we do know that structure is more conserved than sequence, we may use the structure to find out the function of our dark proteins. There are a few resources for this, I’d suggest you to try FoldSeek (Kempen et al., n.d.) and Dali (Holm 2022) servers. You can upload the PDB of your model and search for related structures in PDB and also in Alphafold database.\nAs mentioned above, Colabfold aims to make the process faster by using MMSeqs in the first block. Additionally, the number of recycling steps can also be adapted. Moreover, different Colabfold notebooks have been developed (and evolved) to allow some customization and other feature, like batch processing of multiple proteins avoiding recompilation and identification of protein-protein interactions (Mirdita et al. 2022).\nAlphafold models can be evaluated by the mean pLDDT, a per-residue confidence metric. It is stored in the B-factor fields of the mmCIF and PDB files available for download (although unlike a B-factor, higher pLDDT is better). The model confidence can vary greatly along a chain so it is important to consult the confidence when interpreting structural features. Very often, the lower confidence fragments are not product of a poor prediction but an indicator of protein disorder (Wilson, Choy, and Karttunen 2022).\nAlphafold also partnered with EMBL-EBI and Uniprot and generated a huge curated database of proteins from model organisms (Varadi et al. 2022), the Alphafold database. This is an amazing resource that may be also very helpful for you. Just consider that this database increased from 48% to 76% the fraction of human proteome with structural data, and also it also means great increases in the case of other model organisms, like, including microorganisms and plants (Porta-Pardo et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Changes in protein structural coverage in model organisms."

Notebooks are very important also for reproducibility in computer sciences, as they allow you to have the background and details and the actual code in a single document and also execute it. You can share those notebooks very easily and also update quickly as they are stored in your Google Drive.\nColabfold allow you to run notebooks of Alphafold and RoseTTAfold for specific applications, allowing even to run a bunch of proteins in batch. You can see a more detailed description in Mirdita et al. (2022). We are using the Alphafold2_mmseqs2 notebook, that allow you most of the common features. You need to allow Colab to use your Google account.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing your sequence in Colabfold\n\n\nThen paste your sequence and chose a name. For more accurate models you can click “use_amber” option. It will run a short Molecular Dynamics protocol that ultimately optimize the modeling, but it will also take some more time, so better try at home.\nAs you can see, an this is a recent feature, you can also add your own template. That will safe time, but of course without any guarantee. If you have a template of a related protein, like an alternative splicing or a disease mutant, I’d advise you to try with and without the template. You may surprise.\n\n\n\nExecuting Colabfold\n\n\nAt this point, you may execute the whole pipeline or may some more customization. MSA stage can be also optimized to reduce execution time, by reducing database or even by providing your own MSA. Very often you may want to fold a protein with different parameters, particularly in the Advanced Colabfold, which may very convenient to reuse an MSA from a previous run (although they recently updated servers for MMSeqs and made it really faster). If your proteins are in the same operon or by any other reason you think that they should have co-evolved, you prefer a “paired” alignment. But you can always do both.\nAdvanced settings are specially needed for protein-protein complexes. Also the number of recycling steps will improve your model, particularly for targets with no MSA info from used databases. Then you can just get your model (and companion info and plots) in your GDrive or download it.\nWhat do you think is the ideal protein for alphafold2? Do you think homology modeling is dead?"

    "text": "As in the case of sequences, comparison and alignment of protein structures is a fundamental and widely used task in computational structure biology. The identification and statistical measure of the similarities between two or more structures allow their classification and infer functional and evolutionary relationships. Moreover, this process is essential during protein modeling, allowing to identify, assess, and select intermediate models.\nIt is also important to clear up any possible confusion between alignment and superposition, as they are often interchanged in the literature. An structural alignment tries to identify similarities and differences between two structures, while structure superposition requires the previous knowledge of such equivalences. Thus, superposition tires to minimize the distance between already known equivalent structures by finding a transformation that produces either the lowest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) or the maximal equivalences within an RMSD cutoff. The RMSD can be calculated for any pair of molecules. Regarding proteins, we usually refer to the RMSD of the alpha-carbons. A better alignment will allow a better superposition. Thus, although alignment and superposition are two different processes, the RMSD can be used as an indication of both (the lowest RMSD, the best alignment/superposition).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Structural alignment of three different AP endoncleases with the cealign algorithm implemented in Pymol.

    "text": "2.1 Sequence databases\n\n2.1.1 Uniprot\nThe Uniprot databases are maintained by the Uniprot consortium, created in 2002 by EMBL-EBI, SIB, and PIR. Uniprot can be considered nowadays as a metadatabase as its entries contain information from diverse sources. It was created with two goals, constitute a non-redundant comprehensive protein sequence database and enrich that database with annotation of those proteins. Annotations include, but it is not limited to: protein and gene families, function and structure-function available data, interactions with other proteins or cofactor, localization, patterns of expression, variants… Thus, it aims to join the goals of both primary and secondary DDBBs.\nThe central hub of Uniprot databases is Uniprot Knowledgebase. It is a collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent, and rich annotation. The UniProtKB consists of two internal databases: a section containing manually-annotated records with information extracted from literature, community suggestions, and curator-evaluated computational analysis, and a section with computationally analyzed records. For the sake of continuity and name recognition, the two sections are referred to as “UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot” (reviewed, manually annotated) and “UniProtKB/TrEMBL” (unreviewed, automatically annotated), respectively.\nBesides cross-references to structural information, in the last years, UniprotKB has also incorporated structural data from Alphafold database (created by DeepMind and EBI), see “State-of-the-art protein modeling with Deep Learning-based methods” module.\nSequences with different detail of annotation can be found in two overlapping and complementary databases in Uniprot: Uniparc and Uniref. Briefly, UniParc (UniProt Archive) is a comprehensive and non-redundant database that contains most of the publicly available protein sequences in the world. UniParc avoided redundancy by storing each unique sequence only once and giving it a stable and unique identifier (UPI) making it possible to identify the same protein from different source databases. A UPI is never removed, changed, or reassigned. On the other hand, UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniprotKB (and selected UniParc records) in order to obtain complete coverage of the sequence space at several resolutions while hiding redundant sequences (but not their descriptions) from view. The UniRef100 database combines identical sequences into a single UniRef entry, displaying the sequence of a representative protein, the accession numbers of all the merged entries, and links to the corresponding. UniRef90 is built by clustering UniRef100 sequences using the MMseqs2 algorithm (Steinegger and Söding 2018) such that each cluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% sequence identity and 80% overlap with the longest sequence (a.k.a. seed sequence ) of the cluster. Similarly, UniRef50 is built by clustering UniRef90 seed sequences that have at least 50% sequence identity to and 80% overlap with the longest sequence in the cluster. UniParc and Uniref contain only protein sequences. All other information about the protein must be retrieved from the source databases using the database cross-references.\n\n\n2.1.2 InterPro\nInterPro aims to be a functional secondary database, by classifying proteins into families, domains, and important sites. To classify proteins in this way, InterPro uses predictive models, known as signatures, provided by several different databases (up to 13) that make up the InterPro consortium. InterPro combines those different signatures representing equivalent families, domains, or sites, and provides additional information such as descriptions, literature references, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a comprehensive resource for protein classification (see Blum et al. (2021)).\nInterPro database is updated every 2 months and it is very useful for annotation of ORFans or divergent proteins.\n\n\n2.1.3 Pfam\nPfam is a protein database that aims to classify sequences by their evolutionary relationships. It was founded in 1995 and it has been very useful for functional annotation of genomic data. Pfam’s website (http://pfam.xfam.org/) will be closed by the end of 2022. However, Pfam database will not be discontinued but integrated into the InterPro web site (see the Xfam Blog entry).\nPfam uses HMM profiles (we will discuss HMMs in the Homology Modeling module) to classify proteins into families, which are grouped into clans. Check out the EBI course about using Pfam: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/pfam-creating-protein-families/\nThe current release (35.0) contains 19,632 entries (families and clans). Pfam was designed as a database that should be often updated in the fast-forward genomic era. To this aim, they use two alignment types. Each Pfam family has a seed alignment that contains a representative set of sequences for the entry. A profile hidden Markov model (HMM) is automatically built from the seed alignment and searched against a sequence database called pfamseq using the HMMER3 software (http://hmmer.org/). All sequence regions that satisfy a family-specific curated threshold, also known as the gathering threshold, are aligned to the profile HMM to create the full alignment (Mistry et al. 2020).\nIn addition to the HMM-based Pfam entries (Pfam-A), the Pfam profiles are used to provide a set of unannotated, computationally generated multiple sequence alignments called Pfam-B. However, in the last Pfam versions, the Pfam-B alignments are presently only released on the Pfam FTP site.\nPfam has also been used in the creation of other resources such as Rfam (RNA families) and Dfam (transposable DNA elements)."

    "text": "2.2 Structure databases\n\n2.2.1 RCSB-PDB\nThe Protein Data Bank (PDB, www.rcsb.org) database is the major macromolecule structural primary database (Burley et al. 2020). It contains mostly protein structures, but also spans nucleic acids and nucleoprotein complexes. PDB turned 50 in 2021 and you can see a detailed overview of its history in the RCSB-PDB site.\nBriefly, the PDB was established in 1971 at Brookhaven National Laboratory with only 7 structures. Then, the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), formed by Rutgers, UCSD/SDSC, and CARB/NIST, became responsible for the management of the PDB in 1998 in response to an RFP and a lengthy review process. In 2003, the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) was formed to maintain a single PDB archive of macromolecular structural data that is freely and publicly available to the global community. It consists of organizations that act as deposition, data processing and distribution centers for PDB data.\nPDB structures are largely obtained by X-ray crystallography, but it accepts derived from EM and RMN data since 1989 and 1991, respectively. Indeed, the BMRB (Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank) has partnered with the PDB since 2006 and the EMBD (Electron Microscopy Data Bank) since 2021. Furthermore, starting September 2022, the PDB also contains computed models from the Alphafold database (which we will discuss later in this course) and RoseTTAFold-ModelArchive. Thus, the PDB database is the major hub that centralizes biological structures nowadays.\nPDB database has four mirrors and websites (RCSB, Europe, BMRB, and Japan) with mainly overlapping information, although they have some specialization. The RCSB PDB site has also an educational section (PDB-101) with very useful info and resources for teaching and learning structural biology and the work with PDB structures.\nThe PDB entries contain all the information about the structure, spanning from the protein sequence and source to the experiment details, as well as the structure assessment (see Structural quality assurance section) and visualization. You can download all this information and the structure coordinates in diverse file formats.\n\n\n2.2.2 SCOP\nThe Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP, http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk) database is a classification of protein domains organized according to their evolutionary and structural relationships in hierarchical categories. The main unit is the family that groups related proteins with clear evidence for their evolutionary origin while the superfamily brings together more distantly related protein domains. Further, superfamilies are grouped into distinct folds on the basis of the global structural features shared by the majority of their members. Domain definitions are provided for the two main levels of the SCOP classification, family and superfamily, and the domain boundaries for each of these can coincide or differ (Andreeva et al. 2020).\nFor each group, a representative is selected based on its sequence (UniProtKB) and structure (PDB) and used for SCOP classification. Thus, the SCOP domain boundaries are assigned to both, the PDB and UniProtKB entry.\n\n\n2.2.3 CATH\nCATH (www.cathdb.info) is a free, publicly available resource that identifies protein domains within proteins from the Protein Data Bank and classifies them into evolutionary-related groups according to sequence, structure, and function information. It assumes that related proteins which fold alike often exhibit similar functions (this only could be demonstrated if we find intermediates). CATH uses a hierarchical classification scheme where the units compared and classified are structural domains. Domains, defined here as globular structural domains capable of semi-independent folding, are extracted from experimentally determined protein structures available in the PDB database. The domains are classified into the following hierarchical levels that compose the CATH name: Class (C), Architecture (A), Topology (T), and Homologous superfamilies (H).\nCATH uses a combination of several structure-based (SSAP, CATHEDRAL) and sequence-based (Needleman-Wunsch-based sequence alignments, Jackhmmer, Profile Comparer, and HHsearch) algorithms to assess the similarity of domains to each other and to identify protein homologues (Sillitoe et al. 2021).\nCATH has a sister resource, Gene3D, that adds in additional protein domain sequences with no known structure, which brings the current total number of domains in CATH-Gene3D up to 95 million.\nCATH database is updated quite regularly through daily snapshots (CATH-B), but a full release with more tools, named CATH+ is released every 12 months. CATH-plus contains functional families (CATH-FunFams), structural clusters, and other tools (Sillitoe et al. 2021)."

It requires the generation of a crystal of the molecule of interest that is then mounted on a goniometer and illuminated or irradiated with a focused beam of X-rays. The diffraction pattern of the X-rays at the other side of the crystal allow the determination of the atoms positions, as well as their chemical bonds, their crystallographic disorder, and various other information. However, the link between the diffraction pattern and the electron density is not trivial and requires some complex maths, called Fourier transforms.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Schematic workflow of X-ray crystallography. From Creative Structure website.\n\n\nX-ray is a powerful method that allows obtaining high-resolution structures at the atomic level of soluble or membrane proteins, either as an apoenzyme or as a holoenzyme bound to substrate, cofactor or drugs. However, the sample must be crystallizable (i.e. homogeneous), which requires quite an amount of very pure protein. Another con of X-ray structures is that, as mentioned, you only obtain one (or very few) static forms of the protein and the location of hydrogen atoms cannot be determined by conventional diffraction methods—the fact that they have only one electron—makes them very hard to detect with x-rays accurately because x-rays scatter from the electron density. They can be predicted, but that still hinders some chemical analysis."

Therefore, if we apply a magnetic field we can obtain an electromagnetic signal with a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus. That is the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).\nAlso, we should consider that the movement of the nucleus is not isolated–it interacts with the surrounding atoms both intra- and inter-molecularly. Thus, through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, structural information of a given molecule can be obtained. Taking protein as an example, its secondary structure, such as α-helix, β-sheet, turn, circular, and curl, reflect the different arrangement of the main chain atoms of protein molecules three-dimensionally. The spacing of the atomic nuclei in different secondary domains, the interaction between nuclei, and the dynamic characteristics of polypeptide segments all directly reflect the three-dimensional structure of proteins. These nuclear features all contribute to spectroscopic behaviors of the analyzed sample, thus providing characteristic NMR signals. Interpretation of these signals by computer-aided methods leads to deciphering of the three-dimensional structure.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Basis of nuclear magnetic resonance. From Creative Structure website.\n\n\nThe most important feature of the NMR method is that the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules in the natural state can be measured directly in solution, and NMR may provide unique information about dynamics and intermolecular interactions. The resolution of the macromolecular three-dimensional structure can be as low as sub nanometer. However, the NMR spectrum of biomolecules with large molecular weight is very complicated and difficult to interpret, thereby limiting the application of NMR in analyzing large biomolecules, often below 20-30 kDa (see Figure 4). Additionally, this technique requires relatively large amounts of pure samples (on the order of several mg) to achieve a reasonable signal to noise level.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Coverage of molecular weight by structural technique.

Samples are prepared through cryopreservation prior to analysis. The coherent electrons are used as a light source to measure the sample. After the electron beam passes through the sample, a complex lens system converts the scattered signal into a magnified image recorded on the detector. A key subsequent step is signal processing, that transform thousands of images of the particles in any orientation into a three-dimensional structure of the sample.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The process of Cryo-EM single particle analysis technique. From Creative Structure website.\n\n\nThe use of electron microscopy methods for structural biology was traditionally limited to very large macromolecular complexes, like viral capsids, and only recently it could be used for smaller particles (see Figure 4). The number of protein structures being determined by cryo-electron microscopy is growing at an explosive rate in the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to several technical improvements in the technique, spanning sample preparation, analysis and processing that allow obtaining pictures at the atomic level (Callaway 2020). This advances were acknowledged by the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Cryo-electron microscopy revolution. From Creative Structure website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the already classic article by Egelman (2016) for more a detailed info. And here for a great outreaching article after the Nobel Prize.\n\n\n\nCryoEM is widely use nowadays because, particularly for large molecular complexes or viral particles. Structures can be generated quickly, as it does not require a high amount of protein and it can generate good data even in the presence of impurities. However, new generation microscopes are only affordable by large institutions and small particles can have a high level of noise. Moreover, processing a large amount of images can be limiting to obtain high-quality structures."

    "section": "4.1 Protein structure file formats",
    "text": "4.1 Protein structure file formats\nExperimental structural data from different methods is stored in different file formats. For instance, crystallographic raw data is usually saved as *.ccp4 files, but Cryo-EM or X-ray density maps can be stored in *.mrc or *.mtz files. Other complex file formats, such as the Extensible Markup Language *.xml, provide a framework for structure complex information and documents like protein structures.\nAlong with the establishment of the PDB, a simple format was developed. The PDB format consist of a collection of fixed format records that describe the atomic coordinates, chemical and biochemical features, experimental details of the structure determination, and some structural features such as secondary structure assignments, hydrogen bonding, or active sites. The current version is named PDBx/mmCIF)also incorporates the expanded crystallographic information file format (mmCIF), allowing the representation of large structures, complex chemistry, and new and hybrid experimental methods. Thus a *.pdb and *.cif files can be considered as identical files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck PDB-101 course about PDBx/mmCIF format here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Coordinates in the PDB file (6KI3)\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Occupancy and B-factor\nDisregarding the repetition of atom type in the rightmost column, the last columns in the PDB file are the Occupancy and the temperature factor or the B-factor.\nMacromolecular crystals are composed of many individual molecules packed into a symmetrical arrangement. In some crystals, there are slight differences between each of these molecules. For instance, a sidechain on the surface may wag back and forth between several conformations, or a substrate may bind in two orientations in an active site, or a metal ion may be bound to only a few of the molecules. When researchers build the atomic model of these portions, they can use the occupancy to estimate the amount of each conformation that is observed in the crystal.\nThus, by definition, the sum of occupancy values for each atom must be 1. Usually, we will see a single record for an atom, with an occupancy value of 1, indicating that the atom is found in all of the molecules in the same place in the crystal. However, if a metal ion binds to only half of the molecules in the crystal, the researcher will see a weak image of the ion in the electron density map, and can assign an occupancy of 0.5 in the PDB structure file for this atom. Two (or more) atom records are included for each atom, with occupancies like 0.5 and 0.5, or 0.4 and 0.6, or other fractional occupancies that sum to a total of 1.\nOn the other hand, temperature value or B-factor is a measure of our confidence in the location of each atom, as discussed above (Section 3). If you find an atom on the surface of a protein with a high temperature factor, keep in mind that this atom is probably moving a lot, and that the coordinates specified in the PDB file are only one possible snapshot of its location. Thus, an atom record with an occupancy <1 can have a low B-factor if that position is certain.\nAs you can imagine, this column is also used by computationally-derived models to include a confidence value."

    "section": "3.1 Global parameters in experimentally-based structures",
    "text": "3.1 Global parameters in experimentally-based structures\nThere are a number of diverse parameters that help us to understand the quality and reliability of an structure. First, the resolution is a good indicator of the level of detail of the structure, as it can strongly affect affect how the experimental data is modeled.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The effect of resolution on the quality of the electron density. The Tyr100 residue from concanavalin A as found in the indicated PDB structures at 3 Å, 2 Å and 1.2 Å. Picture inspired in Figure 14.5 from Gu and Bourne (2009) and rendered with Pymol (see concanavalin.pse and concanavalin.txt in the Repo for details about the picture display).\n\n\nOther important parameter is the R-factor, which assess the difference between the structure factors calculated from the model and those obtained from the experimental data. This is, the R-factor is the deviation of the calculated diffraction pattern of the model and the original experimental diffraction pattern. Typically, good structures with a resolution around 1-3 Å, will have an R-factor of 0.2 (i.e., 20% of deviation). However, it should be noted that this factor is usually reduced after iterative refinement, which downplays its use as an indicative of reliability. A more reliable factor is the Rfree. This is less susceptible to manipulation during refinement, as it is based only in a small fraction of the experimental data (5-10%) that is not used throughout the refinement stage.\nA more intuitive, but only qualitative, way of understand the presicion of a given atom’s coordinates is the B-factor. The temperature value or B-factor correlates with the positional errors, although its mathematical definition is more complex. Normal values for a B-factor are within the range 14-30, whereas values above 30 usually indicate that the atom is within a flexible or disordered region, and atoms with a B-factor over 40 are often excluded as being too unreliable.\nThe root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD, see Structure alignment section) is a traditional estimator of the quality of NMR-solved structures. Regions with high RMSD values are those that are less defined by data. However, it should be also noted that this parameter can be also misleading as it is highly dependent on the procedure used to generate the and selection the data that is submitted to the PDB. An experimentalist could reduce the RMSD by choosing the “best” few structures for deposition from a much larger draft. Note that the RMSD has many other applications, like comparing different structures or models from the same or related sequences.\nIn the last years, along with the boost in quantity and quality of EM structures, new parameters have been proposed. One of them, the Q-factor has been recently implemented for validation of 3DEM/PDB structures. Briefly, the Q-score calculates the resolvability of atoms by measuring similarity of the map values around each atom relative to a Gaussian-like function for a well resolved atom. Q-score of 1 indicates that the similarity is perfect whilst closer to 0 indicates the similarity is low. If the atom is not well placed in the map then a negative Q-score value may be reported. Therefore, Q-score values in the reports will be in a range of -1 to +1."

    "text": "3.2 Stereochemical parameters\nGiven that all structural models contain some degree of error and some of the modeling global parameters can be controversial, we can analyze the model’s geometry, stereochemistry, and other structural properties to assess structural models (experimentally or computationally obtained). These parameters compare a given structure (protein or nucleic acid) against what is already known about this kind of molecule, based on our knowledge from high-res structures. That means that the (best) structures in the current structural space define what is “normal” in a protein structure. The advantage of these analyses and derived parameters is that they do not consider the process that leads to the model, they only consider the final product and its reliability. The main disadvantage is that the current structural space is biased to proteins of known function and with biomedical or biotechnological interest.\nOne of the most common and powerful methods to asses the stereochemistry of a protein is the Ramachandran plot, defined in 1963 and still in use.\nAnother widely used analysis (and available for all PDB structures) is the side chain torsion angles, usually measured as Side chain outliers. As outlined in the Introduction, amino acid side chains also have some preferred conformations. Like the Ramachandran plot, a plot of the χ1-χ2 torsion angles can indicate problems with a protein model when angle values are outside of the high density values.\nBad contact or clashes indicate a bad model. It is obvious that two atoms cannot be in the same (or very close) spot. We can define this as a situation where two nonbonded atoms have a center-to-center distance that is smaller than the sum of their van der Walls radii."

This was initially shown by Gopalasamudram Ramachandran, who also devised a plot to visualize the allowed angle values, so-called Ramachandran plot. This plot can represent the angles of a particular amino acid, of all the amino acids in a protein or many proteins. Analysis of φ and ψ angles in known proteins clearly show that roughly three-quarters of all possible φ, ψ combinations are excluded.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: General Ramachandran plot. The density of points reflects how likely is each angle combination, defining the core (red line) and tolerance (orange) regions.\n\n\nThe core regions in the Rama plot also correspond with common secondary structures, as usually represented in textbooks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Definition of secondary structure alternatives by their combination of phi, psi angles.\n\n\nFunctionally and structurally relevant residues are more likely than others to have torsion angles that can be distributed into the allowed but disfavored regions of a Ramachandran plot.

Such conformations need to be stabilized by the protein using H-bonds, steric packing, or other means, and should very seldom occur for highly solvent-exposed residues.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Ramachandran plots for glycine (lef) and proline (right) Inner contour encloses 98% and 99.9% of Top structures data, indicating the favored and allowed regions, respectively ."

    "text": "2.2 Protein folds, domains and motifs\nThe final three dimensional tertiary structure of a protein is commonly referred as its fold. Within the overall protein fold, we can recognize distinct domains and motifs. Domains are compact sections of the protein that represent structurally and (usually) functionally independent regions. That means that a domain maintain its main features, even if separated from the overall protein. On the other hand, motifs are small substructures that are not necessarily independent and consist of only a few secondary structure stretches. Indeed, motifs can be also referred as super-secondary structure.\nThe diversity of protein folds, domains and motifs, and combination of those, can be used for classification of protein structures hierarchically, as in many other fields of biology. The first classification was proposed in the 70’s and consisted of four groups of folds, as shown in the figure below. All-α proteins are based almost entirely on an α-helical structure, and all β-structure are based on β-sheets. α/β structure is based on as mixture of α-helices and β-sheet, often organized as parallel β-strands connected by α-helices. Finally α+β structures consist of discrete α-helix and β-sheet motifs that are not interwoven (as they are in α/β proteins).\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The four structural protein classes in the classification by Chlothia & Levitt. Modified from Gu and Bourne (2009) using 1I2T, 1K76, 1H75 and 1EM7 structures.\n\n\nAs known fold space has become more and more complex, these types of classifications have been adjusted and extended such that a complete hierarchy is created. The most commonly referred approaches to this sort of classification are those used by SCOP and CATH databases, as we will see in the Structural Databases section."

This is the CASP or Critical assessment of Protein Structure Prediction.\n\n\n\nComparative z-core of CASP13 participants. The score is based in the GDT_TS (Global distance test).\n\n\nThe best research groups in the field test their new methods and protocols in CASP. However, in CASP13 (2018) an AI company called Deepmind (Google Subsidiary) entered in the scene. Their method, named Alphafold (Senior et al. 2020) clearly won CASP13. Alphafold implemented some improvements in a few recently used approaches, creating a new whole pipeline. Basically, instead of create contact maps from the alignment to then fold the structure, they used a MRF unit (Markov Random Field) to extract in advance the main features of sequence and the MSA and process all of that info into a multilayer NN (called ResNet) that provides the distant map and other information. Then, Alphafold uses all the possibly obtained information to create the structure and then improve it by energy minimization and substitution of portions with a selected DB of protein fragments.\n\n\n\nWorkflow of the first Alphafold method presented in CASP13. MSA stands for multiple sequence alignment; PSSM indicates Position-specific-scoring matrix and MRF stands for Markov Random Field (or Potts model). From the Sergei Ovchinnikov and Martin Steinegger presentation of Alphafold2 to the Boston Protein Design Group (link below)\n\n\nAfter Alphafold, similar methods were also developed and made available to the general public, like the trRosetta from Baker lab (Yang et al. 2020), available in the Robetta server. This led to some controversy (mostly on Twitter) about the open access to the CASP software and later on DeepMind publishes all the code on GitHub."

    "text": "From homology modeling to threading\nAs mentioned earlier, the introduction of HMM-based profiles during the first decade of this century led to a great improvement in template detection and protein modeling in the twilight zone, i.e., proteins with only distant homologs (<25-30% identity) in databases. Current version of SwissModel and the use of HHPred+Modeller already rely on HMM profiles for template identification and alignment. In order to exploit the power of HMM searches, those methods naturally evolved into iterative threading methods, based on multitemplate model construction, implemented in I-TASSER (Roy, Kucukural, and Zhang 2010), Phyre2 (Kelley et al. 2015), and RosettaCM (Song et al. 2013), among others. These methods methods are usually referred as Threading or Fold-recognition methods. Both terms can be often used interchangeably, although some authors see threading as any technique that uses structural information in addition to sequence information to identify remote homologies, while threading would be a more complex process of modeling including remote homologies and also modeling of pairwise amino acid interactions in the structure. Therefore, although we have already used HHPred along with the use of HHPred to identify templates for a subsequent modeling, could be indeed considered as threading.\nThe iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) from Yang Zhang lab is one of the most widely used threading methods and servers. This method was was ranked as the No 1 server for protein structure prediction in the community-wide CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CASP10, CASP11, CASP12, CASP13, and CASP14 experiments. I-TASSER first generates three-dimensional (3D) atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations that are iteratively selected and improved. The quality of the template alignments (and therefore the difficulty of modeling the targets) is judged based on the statistical significance of the best threading alignment, i.e., the Z-score, which is defined as the energy score in standard deviation units relative to the statistical mean of all alignments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Flowchart of I-TASSER protein structure modeling. From Rigden (2017).\n\n\nFirst, I-TASSER uses Psi-BLAST against a curated databases to select sequence homologs and generate a sequence profile. That profile is used to predict secondary structure and generate multiple fragmented models using several programs. The top template hits from each threading program are then selected for the following steps. In the second stage, continuous fragments in threading alignments are excised from the template structures, and are used to assemble structural conformations of the sections that aligned well, with the unaligned regions (mainly loops/tails) built by ab initio modeling. The fragment assembly is performed using a modified replica-exchange Monte Carlo random simulation technique, which implements several replica simulations in parallel using different conditions that are periodically exchanged. Those simulations consider multiple parameters, including model statistics (stereochemical outliers, H-bond, hydrophobicity…), spatial restrains and amino acid pairwise contact predicions (see below). In each step, output models are clustered to select the representative ones for the next stage. A final refinement step include rotamers modeling and filtering out steric clashes.\nOne interesting thing about I-TASSER is that it is integrated within a server with many other applications, including some of the tools that I-TASSER uses and other advanced methods based by I-TASSER, like I-TASSER-MTD for large, multidomain proteins or C-I-TASSER that implements a deep learning step, similar to Alphafold2 (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: RosettaCM Protocol.

    "text": "The recent history of protein structure modeling telling by a contest (CASP)\nEvery two years since 1994, structural bioinformatics groups carry out a worldwide experiment, predicting a set of unknown protein structures in a controlled, blind-test-like competition and comparing their output with the experimentally obtained structure. This is the CASP or Critical assessment of Protein Structure Prediction.\n\n\n\nComparative z-core of CASP13 participants. The score is based in the GDT_TS (Global distance test).\n\n\nThe best research groups in the field test their new methods and protocols in CASP. However, in CASP13 (2018) an AI company called Deepmind (Google Subsidiary) entered in the scene. Their method, named Alphafold (Senior et al. 2020) clearly won CASP13. Alphafold implemented some improvements in a few recently used approaches, creating a new whole pipeline. Basically, instead of create contact maps from the alignment to then fold the structure, they used a MRF unit (Markov Random Field) to extract in advance the main features of sequence and the MSA and process all of that info into a multilayer NN (called ResNet) that provides the distant map and other information. Then, Alphafold uses all the possibly obtained information to create the structure and then improve it by energy minimization and substitution of portions with a selected DB of protein fragments.\n\n\n\nWorkflow of the first Alphafold method presented in CASP13. MSA stands for multiple sequence alignment; PSSM indicates Position-specific-scoring matrix and MRF stands for Markov Random Field (or Potts model).

    "section": "Why is Alphafold2 so freaking accurate?",
    "text": "Why is Alphafold2 so freaking accurate?\nThe philosophy behind Alphafold and related methods is treating the protein folding problem as a machine learning problem, kind of of image processing. In all these problems, the input to the Deep Learning model is a volume (3D tensor). In the case of computer vision, 2D images expand as a volume because of the RGB or HSV channels. Similarly, in the case of distance prediction, predicted 1D and 2D features are transformed and packed into 3D volume with many channels of inter-residue information (Pakhrin et al. 2021).\n\n\n\nFrom the perspective of Deep Learning method development, the problem of protein distogram or real-valued distance prediction (bottom row) is similar to the ‘depth prediction problem’ in computer vision. From Pakhrin et al. (2021).\n\n\nAlphafold2 can be explained as a pipeline with three interconected tasks (see picture below). First, it queries several databases of protein sequences and constructs an MSA that is used to select templates. In the second part of the diagram, AlphaFold 2 takes the multiple sequence alignment and the templates, and processes them in a transformer. This process has been referred by some authors as inter-residue interaction map-threading (Bhattacharya et al. 2021). The objective of this part is to extract layers of information to generate residue interaction maps. A better model of the MSA will improve the network’s characterization of the geometry, which simultaneously will help refine the model of the MSA. Importantly, in the AF2 Evoformer, this process is iterative and the information goes back and forth throughout the network. At every recycling step, the complexity of the map increases and thus, the model improves (the original model uses 3 cycles). As explained in the great post from Carlos Outerial at the OPIG site:\n\nThis is easier to understand as an example. Suppose that you look at the multiple sequence alignment and notice a correlation between a pair of amino acids. Let’s call them A and B. You hypothesize that A and B are close, and translate this assumption into your model of the structure. Subsequently, you examine said model and observe that, since A and B are close, there is a good chance that C and D should be close. This leads to another hypothesis, based on the structure, which can be confirmed by searching for correlations between C and D in the MSA. By repeating this several times, you can build a pretty good understanding of the structure.\n\nThe third part of the pipeline is the structure building module, which uses the information from the previous steps to construct a 3D model structure protein of the query sequence. This network will give you a single model, without any energy optimization step. Model building is based in a new concept of 3D structures generation, named IPA (Invariant Point Attention) and the use of a curated list of parametrised list of torsion angles to generate the side chains.\n\n\n\n\n\nOxford Proteins Informatics Group Blog, modified From\n\n\nLike for most of the previous methods Alphafold would give your better results with proteins with related structures known and with a lot of homologs in Uniref databases. However, comparing to nothing, it will likely give you (limited) useful results for the so-called “dark genome”. I work with phages and bacterial mobile elements, and sequencing that is often frustrating as more than 50% of the proteins have no homologs in the database. So you have a bunch of proteins of unknown function… However, as we do know that structure is more conserved than sequence, we may use the structure to find out the function of our dark proteins. There are a few resources for this, I’d suggest you to try FoldSeek [Kempen et al. (n.d.)] and Dali [Holm (2022)] servers. You can upload the PDB of your model and search for related structures in PDB and also in Alphafold database.\nAs mentioned above, Colabfold aims to make the process faster by using MMSeqs in the first block. Additionally, the number of recycling steps can also be adapted. Moreover, different Colabfold notebooks have been developed (and evolved) to allow some customization and other feature, like batch processing of multiple proteins avoiding recompilation and identification of protein-protein interactions (Mirdita et al. 2022).\nAlphafold models can be evaluated by the mean pLDDT, a per-residue confidence metric. It is stored in the B-factor fields of the mmCIF and PDB files available for download (although unlike a B-factor, higher pLDDT is better). The model confidence can vary greatly along a chain so it is important to consult the confidence when interpreting structural features. Very often, the lower confidence fragments are not product of a poor prediction but an indicator of protein disorder.\nAlphafold also partnered with EMBL-EBI and Uniprot and generated a huge curated database of proteins from model organisms (Varadi et al. 2022), the Alphafold database. This is an amazing resource that may be also very helpful for you. Just consider that this database increased from 48% to 76% the fraction of human proteome with structural data, and also it also means great increases in the case of other model organisms, like, including microorganisms and plants (Porta-Pardo et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in protein structural coverage in model organisms."

Notebooks are very important also for reproducibility in computer sciences, as they allow you to have the background and details and the actual code in a single document and also execute it. You can share those notebooks very easily and also update quickly as they are stored in your Google Drive.\nColabfold allow you to run notebooks of Alphafold and RoseTTAfold for specific applications, allowing even to run a bunch of proteins in batch. You can see a more detailed description in Mirdita et al. (2022). We are using the Alphafold2_mmseqs2 notebook, that allow you most of the common features. You need to allow Colab to use your Google account.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing your sequence in Colabfold\n\n\nThen paste your sequence and chose a name. For more accurate models you can click “use_amber” option. It will run a short Molecular Dynamics protocol that ultimately optimize the modeling, but it will also take some more time, so better try at home.\nAs you can see, an this is a recent feature, you can also add your own template. That will safe time, but of course without any guarantee. If you have a template of a related protein, like an alternative splicing or a disease mutant, I’d advise you to try with and without the template. You may surprise.\n\n\n\nExecuting Colabfold\n\n\nAt this point, you may execute the whole pipeline or may some more customization. MSA stage can be also optimized to reduce execution time, by reducing database or even by providing your own MSA. Very often you may want to fold a protein with different parameters, particularly in the Advanced Colabfold, which may very convenient to reuse an MSA from a previous run (although they recently updated servers for MMSeqs and made it really faster). If your proteins are in the same operon or by any other reason you think that they should have co-evolved, you prefer a “paired” alignment. But you can always do both.\nAdvanced settings are specially needed for protein-protein complexes. Also the number of recycling steps will improve your model, particularly for targets with no MSA info from used databases. Then you can just get your model (and companion info and plots) in your GDrive or download it.\nWhat do you think is the ideal protein for alphafold2? Do you think homology modeling is dead?"

The coverage of the protein structure space has been greatly increased (Porta-Pardo et al. 2022).\nHowever, some scientists have claimed that Alphafold2 and RoseTTAfold actually “cheat” a bit as it does not really solve the problem but generate a deep learning pipeline that “bypass” the problem (Pederson 2021). In agreement with that, it has been shown that machine learning methods actually do not reproduce the expected folding pathways while improving the structures during the recycling steps Outeiral, Nissley, and Deane (n.d.).\nIn conclusion, I do believe that Levinthal’s paradox has not been (yet) fully solved, but clearly almost (Al-Janabi 2022), and solving it will probably reduce the limitations of Alphafold2.

    "section": "1D features prediction",
    "text": "1D features prediction\nBy definition 1D features are protein features that can be decoded directly from the protein primary structure and represented as values (categories, %, …) associated to individual residues in the sequence. For instance, we can assign a secondary structure state (symbol or probability) to each residue. Many structure prediction methods implement or call third parties methods to predict secondary structure and other 1D features, as important additional information during modeling process.\nYou can find links to several 1D features prediction tools in the Modeling Resources section.\n\nSecondary structure prediction\nRegarding experimentally-based structures, secondary structures can be automatically assigned using DSSP (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins) algorithm, originally written in 1983 and updated several times throughout the years, being the last version from 2021 (available on GitHub). This algorithm classifies each residue considering its geometry and H-bonds prediction by comparison with pre-existing patterns in DSSP database. Remarkably, DSSP does not predict secondary structures, it just extracts this information from the 3D coordinates.\nPrediction of secondary structure (SS) from protein sequences is based in the hypothesis that Segments of consecutive residues have preferences for certain secondary structure states. Similar to other methods in bioinformatics, including protein modeling, approaches to SS prediction evolved during the last 50 years (see Table 1).\nFirst generation methods rely on statistics approaches and prediction depends on assigning a set of prediction values to a residue \u000band then applying a simple algorithm to those numbers. I.e. apply a probability score based on \u000bsingle amino acid propensity. In the 1990’s, new algorithms included the information of the flanking residues (3-50 nearby amino acids) in the so-called Nearest Neighbor (N-N) Methods. These methods increased the accuracy in many cases but still had strong limitations, as they only considered three possible states (helix, strand or turn). Moreover, as you know from the secondary structure practice, β-strands predictions are more difficult and did not improve much thanks to N-N methods. Additionally, predicted helices and strands were usually too short.\nBy the end of 1990 decade, new methods boosted the accuracy to values near to 80% and even 90%. These methods included two innovations, one conceptual and one methodological. The conceptual innovation was the inclusion of evolutionary information in the predictions, by considering the information of multiple sequence alignments or profiles. If a residue or a type of residue is evolutionary conserved, it is likely that it is important to define SS stretches. The second innovation was the use of neural networks (see below) in which multiple layers of sequence-to-structure predictions were compared with a independently trained networks (see PHD paper by Burkhard Rost here).\nIn the last years, most commoly used methods are meta-servers that compare several algorithms, mostly based o neural-networks, like JPred or SYMPRED, among others.\n\nEvolution of secondary structure prediction methods\n\n\nType\nMethod\nAccuracy\n\n\nStatistics\nChow & Fassman (1974-)\n57%\n\n\n\nG OR (1978-)\n63-73.5%\n(Version V)\n\n\nNearest Neighbor (N-N) methods\nPREDATOR (1996)\n75%\n\n\n\nNNSSP (1995)\n72%\n\n\nN-N neural network\nAPSSP\nUp to 86%\n\n\n\nPsiPRED (1999-)\n75.7% (1999)\n84% (2019)\n\n\n\nPHD (1997)\n74%\n\n\nHMM\nSAM\n76%\n\n\nMETA-Servers\nJpred4\n\n\n\n\nGeneSilico (Discontinued)\n\n\n\n\nSYMPRED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural disorder and solvent accessibility\nThe expression disorder denote protein stretches that cannot be assigned to any SS. They are usually dynamic/flexible, thus with high B-factor or even missing in crystal structures. These fragments show a low complexity and they are usually rich in polar residues, whereas aromatic residues are rarely found in disordered regions. These motifs are usually at the ends of proteins or domain boundaries (as linkers). Additionally, they are frequently related to specific functionalities, such in the case of proteolytic targets or protein-protein interactions (PPI). More rarely, large disordered domains can be conserved in protein families and associated with relevant functions, as in the case of some transcription factors, transcription regulators, kinases…\nThere are many methods and servers to predict disordered regions. You can see a list in the Wikipedia here or in the review by Atkins et al. (2015). The best-known server is DisProt, which uses a large curated database of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions from the literature, which has been recently improved to version 9 in 2022, as described in Quaglia et al. (2022).\nInterestingly, a low plDDT (see below) score in Alphafold2 models has been also suggested as a good indicator of protein disorder (Wilson, Choy, and Karttunen 2022).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of disordered regions. From Database of disordered regions.\n\n\nHydrophobic collapse is usually referred to as a key step in protein folding. Hydrophobic residues tend to be buried inside the protein, whereas hydrophilic, polar amino acids are exposed to the aqueous solvent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Hydrophobic collapse as a early step in protein folding. From Feenstra & Abeln, Introduction to Structural Bioinformatics.\n\n\nSolvent accessibility correlates with residue hydrofobicity \u000b(accessibility methods usually better \u000bperformance). Therefore, estimation of how likely each residue is exposed to the solvent or buried inside the protein is useful to obtain and analyze protein models. Moreover, this information is useful to predict PPIs as well as ligand binding or functional sites. Most methods only classify each residue into two groups: Buried, for those with relative accessibility probability <16% and Exposed, for accessibility residues >16%.\nMost common recent methods, like ProtSA or PROFacc, combine evolutionary information with neural networks to predict accessibility.\n\n\nTrans-membrane motifs and membrane topology\nIdentification of transmembrane motifs is also a key step in protein modeling. About 25-30% of human proteins contain transmembrane elements, most of them in alpha helices.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Different topologies of transmembrane proteins\n\n\nThe PDBTM (Protein Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins) is a comprehensive and up-to-date transmembrane protein selection. As of September 2022, it contains more than 7600 transmembrane proteins, 92.6% of them with alpha helices TM elements. This number of TM proteins is relatively low, as compared with more than 160k structures in PDB, as TM proteins are usually harder to purify and crystalization conditions are often elusive. Thus, although difficult, accurate predictions of TM motifs and overall protein topology can be essential to define protein architecture and identify domains that could be structurally or functionally studied independently.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Different topologies of TM helices.\n\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art TM prediction protocols show an accuracy of 90% for definition of TM elements, but only a 80% regarding the protein topology. However, some authors claim that in some types of proteins, the accuracy is not over 70%, due to the small datasets of TM proteins. Most recent methods, based in deep-learning seem to have increased the accuracy to values near 90% for several groups of proteins (Hallgren et al. 2022).\n\n\nSubcellular localization tags and post-translational modification sites\nMany cellular functions are compartmentalized in the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), or other organules. Therefore, many proteins should be located in those compartments. That is achieved by the presence of some labels, in form of short peptidic sequences that regulate traffic and compartmentalization of proteins within the cells. Typically, N-terminal signals direct proteins to the mitochondrial matrix, ER, or peroxisomes, whereas nucleus traffic is regulated by nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES).\nSimilarly, post-translational modifications very often occur in conserved motifs that contain target residues for phosphorylation or ubiquitination, among other modifications.\nThese short motifs are difficult to predict, as datasets of validated signals are small. The use of consensus sequences allowed predictions, although in many cases with a high level of uncertainty."

    "text": "Threading or Fold-recognition methods\nAs mentioned earlier, the introduction of HMM-based profiles during the first decade of this century led to a great improvement in template detection and protein modeling in the twilight zone, i.e., proteins with only distant homologs (<25-30% identity) in databases. Current version of SwissModel and the use of HHPred+Modeller already rely on HMM profiles for template identification and alignment. In order to exploit the power of HMM searches, those methods naturally evolved into iterative threading methods, based on multitemplate model construction, implemented in I-TASSER (Roy, Kucukural, and Zhang 2010), Phyre2 (L. A. Kelley et al. 2015), and RosettaCM (Song et al. 2013), among others. These methods methods are usually referred as Threading or Fold-recognition methods. Both terms can be often used interchangeably, although some authors see threading as any technique that uses structural information in addition to sequence information to identify remote homologies, while threading would be a more complex process of modeling including remote homologies and also modeling of pairwise amino acid interactions in the structure. Therefore, although we have already used HHPred along with the use of HHPred to identify templates for a subsequent modeling, could be indeed considered as threading.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The idea behind fold-recognition is that instead of comparing sequences, we intend to compare structures. In the Frozen approximation (left), one residue is aligned with the template structure and then we evaluate the probability of the nearby residues in the query sequence to be in the same position than the equivalent in the template. On the other hand, Defrost methods use profiles to generate improved alignments that allow better starting points to the energy calculations during the iterative modeling steps. From Lawrence A. Kelley (2009).\n\n\nThe iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) from Yang Zhang lab is one of the most widely used threading methods and servers. This method was was ranked as the No 1 server for protein structure prediction in the community-wide CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CASP10, CASP11, CASP12, CASP13, and CASP14 experiments. I-TASSER first generates three-dimensional (3D) atomic models from multiple threading alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations that are iteratively selected and improved. The quality of the template alignments (and therefore the difficulty of modeling the targets) is judged based on the statistical significance of the best threading alignment, i.e., the Z-score, which is defined as the energy score in standard deviation units relative to the statistical mean of all alignments.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Flowchart of I-TASSER protein structure modeling. From Rigden (2017).\n\n\nFirst, I-TASSER uses Psi-BLAST against a curated databases to select sequence homologs and generate a sequence profile. That profile is used to predict secondary structure and generate multiple fragmented models using several programs. The top template hits from each threading program are then selected for the following steps. In the second stage, continuous fragments in threading alignments are excised from the template structures, and are used to assemble structural conformations of the sections that aligned well, with the unaligned regions (mainly loops/tails) built by ab initio modeling. The fragment assembly is performed using a modified replica-exchange Monte Carlo random simulation technique, which implements several replica simulations in parallel using different conditions that are periodically exchanged.

    "text": "Threading or Fold-recognition methods\nAs mentioned earlier, the introduction of HMM-based profiles during the first decade of this century led to a great improvement in template detection and protein modeling in the twilight zone, i.e., proteins with only distant homologs (<25-30% identity) in databases. In order to exploit the power of HMM searches, those methods naturally evolved into iterative threading methods, based on multitemplate model construction, implemented in I-TASSER (Roy, Kucukural, and Zhang 2010), Phyre2 (L. A. Kelley et al. 2015), and RosettaCM (Song et al. 2013), among others. These methods are usually referred to as Threading or Fold-recognition methods. Note that the classification of modeling methods is often blurry. The current version of SwissModel and the use of HHPred+Modeller already rely on HMM profiles for template identification and alignment; being thus strictly also fold-recognition methods.\nBoth terms can be often used interchangeably, although some authors see Fold-Recognition as any technique that uses structural information in addition to sequence information to identify remote homologies, while Threading would refer to a more complex process of modeling including remote homologies and also the modeling of pairwise amino acid interactions in the structure. Therefore, although we have already used HHPred along with the use of HHPred to identify templates for subsequent modeling, could be indeed considered threading.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The idea behind fold-recognition is that instead of comparing sequences, we intend to compare structures. In the Frozen approximation (left), one residue is aligned with the template structure and then we evaluate the probability of the nearby residues in the query sequence to be in the same position than the equivalent in the template. On the other hand, Defrost methods use profiles to generate improved alignments that allow better starting points to the energy calculations during the iterative modeling steps. From Lawrence A.
